  "IONQ": "Forensic Equity Analysis: IonQ, Inc. (IONQ)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: IonQ’s capital structure shifted dramatically in H2 2025. The company successfully executed massive \"premium\" equity raises that have significantly de-risked their balance sheet but created new \"ceiling\" dynamics for the common stock.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: 424B5 (October 10, 2025) and S-3ASR (February 26, 2025).\n\nATM Status: IonQ terminated its $500M ATM program in March 2025, citing a \"sufficient amount raised\" and a desire to remove the \"overhang\" during market volatility.\n\nActive Shelf: As of late 2025, IonQ maintains an S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration).\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Based on the October 2025 raise at $93.00, management has signaled they are comfortable issuing equity at a premium. Expect a supply ceiling to form if the stock approaches the $100–$110 psychological barrier, as the company may look to further bolster its $3.5B cash pile for M&A (e.g., following the Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic acquisitions).\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Offering\n\nOffering Type: Registered Direct / Single-Institutional Equity Offering.\n\nDate & Price: October 14, 2025, at $93.00 per share.\n\nThe Buyer: Heights Capital Management (an affiliate of Susquehanna).\n\nStructure: $2.0 Billion investment consisting of 16.5M common shares and 5M pre-funded warrants.\n\nSweeteners: They also received 43 million seven-year warrants with a strike price of $155.00.\n\nAnalyst View: The $93.00 level represents the \"Hard Institutional Floor.\" Large-scale institutional support at this price suggests that downside below this level will likely be met with aggressive defense from the lead investor.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTicker: IONQ.WS (Public Warrants).\n\nExercise Price: $11.50.\n\nTrigger Price (The \"Recall\" Level): Under the standard SPAC-originating warrant agreement (typically found in the S-1/K), the company can force a redemption if the common stock exceeds $18.00 for 20 out of 30 trading days.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: With IONQ trading significantly above $18.00 (recently testing highs near $70-$90), the company has already gained the right to call these warrants.\n\nRedemption Risk: High. The company may choose to \"wipe out\" the time value of the warrants to simplify the capital structure. This usually causes a temporary \"cap\" on the stock as warrant holders sell common stock to cover their exercise costs.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nFinding: Unlike many pre-revenue tech firms, IonQ’s Q3 2025 balance sheet shows $0 Debt.\n\nConversion Risk: Minimal. Because IonQ utilized pure equity and warrants for its $2B raise rather than convertible notes, there is no \"hidden\" conversion price that will cause a sudden flood of shares if a certain price is hit. The main overhang is strictly the 43M warrants at $155.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Expirations: There are no major \"IPO-style\" lock-ups remaining in late 2025.\n\nPlanned Sales: Recent Form 4 filings (Dec 11, 2025) show \"Disposition (Non-Open Market)\" transactions by CEO Niccolo de Masi (16,290 shares) and CFO Inder Singh (12,553 shares). These appear to be tax-withholding sales related to RSU vestings rather than a vote of \"no confidence.\"\n\nUniversity of Chicago Resale: A Nov 10, 2025, prospectus supplement cleared 2.1M shares for resale by the University of Chicago. This is a potential source of minor \"drip\" sell pressure.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$88.00 – $93.00\tProximity to the $2B Heights Capital entry point ($93.00). Institutional support is strongest here.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$135.00 – $155.00\tApproaches the $155 strike price of the 43M institutional warrants. Market will front-run the dilution risk at $155.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to look up the specific Form 4 filing details for any other IonQ directors to see if their selling has accelerated this month?", 
  "qbts": "Forensic Equity Analysis: D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: QBTS has undergone a massive recapitalization in 2025. By aggressively utilizing At-the-Market (ATM) programs and forcing a warrant redemption during the \"Quantum Summer\" rally, the company has built a fortress balance sheet ($800M+ cash) but established very clear \"hard\" price ceilings defined by management’s willingness to dilute.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: 424B5 (June 10, 2025) and 8-K (July 1, 2025).\n\nATM Status: D-Wave completed a massive $400M ATM program in June 2025 at an average price of $15.18. This followed a $150M program completed in January 2025 at $6.10.\n\nActive Shelf: The company remains highly active in its capital markets strategy. Given the current cash position of ~$836M (as of Q3 2025), the immediate need for cash is low.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management demonstrated they will tap the market at significant premiums. A \"Supply Ceiling\" is likely to manifest at the $40.00 – $45.00 range (near 2025 highs), where the company would likely refresh its shelf to fund its M&A strategy (e.g., the Swiss Quantum SA/Italy expansion).\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nOffering Type: The 2025 raises were dominated by ATM sales rather than traditional RDOs with fixed buyers.\n\nThe \"De Facto\" Floor: Significant institutional accumulation occurred during the Q3 2025 rally. Vanguard and UBS added a combined ~21.4M shares in Q3.\n\nPrice Anchor: The average price of the June $400M raise was $15.18. This level serves as the primary \"Institutional Floor.\" Any drop toward $15.00 is likely to see heavy support from the same institutions that provided the $400M in liquidity.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nStatus: RESOLVED/ELIMINATED. * Redemption Event: On October 20, 2025, QBTS announced a forced redemption of all public warrants.\n\nTrigger Details: The trigger was $18.00 for 20 out of 30 trading days.\n\nOutcome: The redemption was completed on November 19, 2025. Approximately 4.75M warrants were exercised at $11.50, injecting ~$54.6M in cash.\n\nCurrent Risk: Zero. The public warrant overhang is gone, and the instruments have been delisted. This \"simplification\" is a net positive for long-term institutional valuation.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nRecent Filing: 10-K / S-3 (Reference to 2025 Senior Notes).\n\nDetails: QBTS had 0% Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2025.\n\nStatus: These notes have reached maturity or were converted during the Q3 price surge. Footnotes from the most recent 10-Q indicate a pivot toward a pure equity/cash capital structure.\n\nOverhang: Negligible. With $800M+ in cash, the company is no longer reliant on predatory convertible debt.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nRecent Activity: High-volume insider selling occurred following the warrant redemption.\n\nKey Sellers (Last 6 Months): * CEO Alan Baratz: Sold ~1M shares (approx. $28.5M).\n\nCFO John Markovich: Sold ~756k shares (approx. $16.7M).\n\nUpcoming Lock-ups: No major restrictive lock-ups are active for the founders. However, the recent heavy selling by the C-suite at prices between $22.00 and $31.00 suggests insiders view the mid-$20s as a \"fair value\" exit point for their own holdings.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$15.50 – $18.50\tAnchored by the $15.18 ATM average and the $18.00 former warrant trigger (now support).\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$35.00 – $46.00\tApproaches the 52-week high ($46.75) where heavy insider selling and potential ATM refreshes create a structural ceiling.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to aggregate this data into your results dictionary now, or should we move on to the next ticker in your list?", 
  "rgti": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Rigetti Computing, Inc. (RGTI)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: Rigetti has aggressively capitalized on the \"Quantum Supercycle\" of late 2024 and 2025. By raising massive cash reserves through At-the-Market (ATM) offerings and a strategic Registered Direct Offering (RDO), the company has moved from \"bankruptcy watch\" in 2023 to a \"fortress balance sheet\" position in late 2025, though at the cost of significant share dilution.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: 424B5 (June 11, 2025) and S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf).\n\nATM Status: Rigetti successfully finalized a $350 million ATM program in June 2025. This followed a $100 million program completed earlier in the year.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: With ~$600M in cash as of November 2025, the immediate pressure to dilute is low. However, management has shown a pattern of tapping the market during volatility. A structural supply ceiling is evident in the $45.00 – $55.00 range, where the stock hit 52-week highs ($58.15) before retreating, likely due to institutional distribution or ATM activity.\n\nPending Shelf: Rigetti maintains an active \"Universal\" Shelf Registration. Based on 2024 filings, they have cleared the path to raise hundreds of millions more if the stock tests new highs.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Direct Offering (RDO)\n\nOffering Date: November 26, 2024.\n\nThe Price: $2.00 per share (50,000,000 shares).\n\nTotal Raised: $100 Million.\n\nThe Buyers: Two unnamed \"Institutional Investors.\"\n\nAnalyst View: While the stock is currently trading significantly higher (~$22–$25), the $2.00 level remains the \"Legacy Hard Floor.\" However, a more relevant \"Modern Floor\" has formed around $15.00 – $18.00, representing the average price at which the $350M ATM was likely distributed into the market throughout H1 2025.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTicker: RGTIW (Public Warrants).\n\nExercise Price: $11.50.\n\nTrigger Price (Redemption Level): $18.00.\n\nRigetti has the right to redeem warrants if the stock price is at least $18.00 for 20 trading days within a 30-day window.\n\nDistance to Trigger: 0% (Trigger Active). Rigetti has already begun benefiting from this. As of November 6, 2025, the company reported receiving $46.5 million from warrant exercises in just one month.\n\nMeasurement Period: Standard 30-day window applies. The company can \"wipe out\" warrant time value at any time now that the stock is consistently above $18.00. Expect a \"Warrant Ceiling\" to persist as holders sell common stock to cover exercise costs.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nStatus: Debt-Free. * Findings: As of Q3 2025 (10-Q filed Nov 2025), Rigetti reports no outstanding debt.\n\nOverhang: The \"overhang\" is now entirely shifted to Earn-out Shares and Warrants. There are no convertible notes with low-priced triggers that could cause a \"death spiral\" scenario. The risk is strictly the conversion of the remaining public and private warrants into common stock.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nRecent Filings: Multiple Form 4s and Form 144s in Q4 2025.\n\nInsider Activity: Significant selling has occurred as the stock price surged. Over the last 3 months, insiders sold $11.6 million worth of shares.\n\nKey Sale: David Rivas (CTO) sold ~$1.1M in late November 2025.\n\nLock-up Status: There are no major lock-ups active; the stock is fully \"unlocked.\" Selling appears to be \"Programmatic\" (Rule 10b5-1) but serves as a constant drag on upward momentum.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$18.00 – $20.00\tAnchored by the warrant trigger support and the Q3 cash injection level. Below $18, the warrant redemption \"floor\" acts as a safety net.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$35.00 – $50.00\tApproaches the upper bound of the $350M ATM distribution and recent analyst downgrades (e.g., B. Riley lowering target to $35).\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to add this to your results dictionary, or should I proceed with the next ticker?", 
  "qubt": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: QUBT has undergone a massive capital transformation in 2025. By shifting from a micro-cap R&D shop to a well-capitalized hardware manufacturer, the company has built a $1.5B+ cash position. However, this has come at the cost of extreme dilution and the establishment of \"institutional ceilings\" that now dominate the stock's price action.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: 424B5 (February 26, 2025) and S-3ASR (October 1, 2025).\n\nATM Status: QUBT aggressively utilized a $500 million ATM program in early 2025. The February 424B5 supplement used a reference price of $29.73 for its dilution calculations, signaling management's willingness to sell in the $25–$30 range.\n\nActive Shelf: The company filed a massive Automatic Shelf Registration (S-3ASR) on October 1, 2025. This allows for virtually unlimited \"at-the-market\" issuance.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Given the recent $750M private placement, immediate cash needs are zero. However, structural resistance exists at $18.00 – $20.00, where the company has historically seen heavy selling and where the \"resale\" of previous private placements often begins to hit the tape.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Private Placements (PIPE)\n\nLast Major Offering: October 5, 2025 (Closed Oct 8).\n\nThe Structure: Oversubscribed Private Placement of 37.1M shares.\n\nThe Price: ~$20.17 per share (derived from $750M total / 37.1M shares).\n\nThe Buyers: A group of institutional investors led by Titan Partners Group.\n\nAnalyst View: The $20.17 level represents the \"Hard Institutional Floor.\" Because this was a \"market-priced\" deal under Nasdaq rules, these institutions are currently \"underwater\" (with the stock trading near $10.22 as of Dec 17). This creates a massive supply overhang between $10 and $20, as these institutions may look to exit if the stock rallies back to their entry point.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTrigger Price: Historically, QUBT warrants (specifically those related to the QPhoton merger) have an $18.00 trigger.\n\nCurrent Status: As of Q3 2025, QUBT saw a $25.8 million decrease in derivative liabilities, indicating that many warrants have either been exercised or moved out of the money.\n\nDistance to Trigger: With the stock currently near $10.22, it is roughly 43% below the $18.00 redemption trigger. There is no immediate risk of a forced redemption \"wipe out,\" but $18.00 remains a formidable psychological and technical resistance level.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nFindings: The company is now overwhelmingly equity-funded.\n\nDebt Status: Short-term debt is effectively $0. Long-term debt is a negligible $1.5 million.\n\nDilution Risk: The risk is no longer \"death spiral\" convertible notes, but rather the resale registration statements for the $1.5 billion in equity raised YTD. Millions of shares from the October and November private placements are hitting the \"float\" as their resale S-3s become effective.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nInsider Sentiment: Negative.\n\nRecent Activity: Significant open-market selling. In September 2025, Director Robert Fagenson and Officer Yuping Huang sold shares in the $14.00 – $16.00 range.\n\nPlanned Sales: Form 144 filings indicate a continued \"drip\" of insider sales to cover tax liabilities and diversify. Over 4.8 million insider shares have been sold in the last 12 months.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$4.40 – $7.50\tThis range aligns with the 52-week lows and the \"pre-hype\" valuation of the photonic foundry. Buy here only if the NASA/NIST contracts show revenue conversion.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$18.00 – $20.00\tThis is the \"Institutional Wall.\" It is the entry price for the $750M October raise and the warrant redemption trigger.

  "laes": "Forensic Equity Analysis: SEALSQ Corp (LAES)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: LAES has transformed its balance sheet in 2025 through a series of massive, high-premium capital raises led by Heights Capital Management. The company has moved from a cash-constrained micro-cap to a \"Quantum Fortress\" with over $430 million in cash, but the capital structure is now heavy with warrant \"overhang\" and institutional floor dynamics that dictate short-term price action.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: 424B5 (December 11, 2025) and S-3 (File No. 333-286098).\n\nATM Status: While LAES utilized an ATM in early 2025, it has shifted to lump-sum Registered Direct Offerings (RDOs) to fund its massive R&D and M&A pivot.\n\nActive Shelf: The company maintains a \"Universal\" shelf. As of mid-December 2025, it has used a significant portion of its April 2025 $200M shelf, but frequently \"refreshes\" it via new F-3 filings.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management recently demonstrated a \"premium tap\" strategy. In December 2025, they priced a raise at $7.50, which was ~26% above the then-market price. Expect the next \"Supply Ceiling\" to materialize at $9.25 – $11.00, aligning with the exercise price of the newest Class D warrants.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nOffering Date: December 11, 2025.\n\nThe Price: $7.50 per share.\n\nTotal Raised: $200 Million (Combined Registered and Private Placement).\n\nThe Buyer: Heights Capital Management, Inc. (Lead Investor).\n\nSweeteners: Warrants with an exercise price of $9.25 (Class D).\n\nAnalyst View: The $7.50 level is the \"Hard Institutional Floor.\" Heights Capital is the dominant force in the cap table; they have repeatedly stepped in at $4.00 (July) and $7.50 (December). Any dip below $7.50 is likely to be defended or viewed as a massive \"buy the dip\" opportunity for institutional followers.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nClass C Warrants (Oct 2025): Exercise Price $5.10.\n\nClass D Warrants (Dec 2025): Exercise Price $9.25.\n\nTrigger Price (Redemption Level): Typically 150% to 200% of the exercise price (found in the \"Description of Securities\" in the F-3). For the $5.10 warrants, the trigger is likely near $7.65 – $10.20.\n\nDistance to Trigger: With the stock currently trading near $4.20 – $4.75 (post-December dip), the stock is currently underwater relative to the $5.10 and $9.25 exercise prices.\n\nWarrant Overhang: High. There are over 80 million warrants outstanding between Class C and D. This creates a \"gravity\" effect—if the stock rallies, warrant holders often sell common shares to \"lock in\" the spread, capping upside momentum.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nFindings: LAES is primarily equity and warrant-funded.\n\nDebt Status: As of Q3 2025, the company has effectively zero traditional convertible debt.\n\nOverhang: The \"dilution\" risk is entirely in the warrants. If LAES hits $10, the \"fully diluted\" share count could nearly double from the current ~177M shares to over 260M shares as warrants move \"In the Money.\"\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Status: Major shareholders and insiders were subject to 90-day lock-ups following the July raise, which expired in October. New 60-90 day lock-ups were likely signed for the December $200M raise.\n\nPlanned Sales: No major Form 4 selling has been reported in Dec 2025. CEO Carlos Moreira has historically maintained his core position, signaling a \"long-term\" vision for the WISeKey/SEALSQ ecosystem.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$3.80 – $4.50\tNear the 52-week support and significantly below the last institutional entry of $7.50. This provides a high \"Margin of Safety.\"\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$7.50 – $9.25\tThis is the \"Institutional Wall.\" It begins at the entry price of the $200M December raise and ends at the $9.25 Class D warrant strike price. Expect heavy distribution here.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to aggregate this into your dictionary, or should I proceed to the next ticker on your list?", 
  "arqq": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Arqit Quantum Inc. (ARQQ)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: Arqit underwent a dramatic capital restructuring in late 2024 and throughout 2025, primarily driven by a 1-for-25 reverse share split in September 2024 and a massive \"Quantum Summer\" pivot in 2025. The company has transitioned from a cash-burn crisis to a more stable $36.9M cash position (as of Sept 30, 2025), but the \"hard\" price levels are now dictated by a new $150M shelf registration and active insider selling.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: F-3 (January 17, 2025) and 424B5 (September 12, 2025).\n\nATM Status: Arqit entered into an At-The-Market Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co. on January 17, 2025, for up to $75 million.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: In September 2025, the company filed a prospectus supplement when the stock was trading near $33.71. Historically, management taps the ATM when the price sustains a 20-30% premium over the last \"Institutional Floor.\" Expect a supply ceiling at the $35.00 – $40.00 range, where the company likely accelerates ATM sales to maintain its 12-month cash runway.\n\nPending Shelf: Approximately $150 million total remains on the universal shelf filed in early 2025 (less amounts sold via ATM).\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Offering: September 30, 2024 (Registered Direct).\n\nThe Price: $0.25 (Pre-Split), which adjusts to $6.25 (Post-Split).\n\nThe Buyers: Insider-heavy group including Heritage Assets SCSP, Notion Capital, and Chairman Garth Ritchie.\n\nModern Support Floor: While $6.25 is the \"legacy\" floor, the 2025 price action established a high-conviction support zone at $11.00 – $13.00 (the 52-week low). Institutional buyers like D'Ovidio have stepped in to buy massive blocks (300k shares) at prices as high as $45.47, though this was followed by significant selling.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTicker: ARQQW.\n\nExercise Price: $287.50 (Post-Split adjustment from $11.50).\n\nNote: Due to the 1:25 split, the public warrants are currently \"deep out of the money.\"\n\nTrigger Price (Redemption): Historically $450.00 (Post-split adjustment from $18.00).\n\nDistance to Trigger: >90%. At a current price near $22.46, the public warrants are functionally \"lottery tickets\" and pose zero immediate redemption risk to the common stock.\n\nPrivate Warrants: Unregistered warrants held by the 2024 RDO participants have a one-year lock-up that expired in late 2025. These are the primary \"dilution\" threats if the stock recovers toward triple digits.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nMaturity Date: June 1, 2025 (Notes have matured).\n\nDetails: The 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes reached maturity earlier this year.\n\nCurrent Status: Most notes were either redeemed for cash or converted during the H1 2025 rally. As of the September 30, 2025 annual results, the company has largely cleared its long-term debt, reducing \"death spiral\" conversion risks.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nSentiment: Highly Negative/Distributive.\n\nRecent Activity: October through December 2025 has seen an avalanche of insider sales.\n\nChairman Garth Ritchie: Sold 114,473 shares (~$6.1M) in Oct 2024.\n\nCEO Andrew Leaver: Sold ~31,000 shares in Q4 2025.\n\nVice Chairman D'Ovidio: Sold 600,000 shares at $57.42 in October.\n\nTakeaway: Insiders aggressively exited positions between $50.00 and $60.00. This creates a massive psychological barrier for retail investors; the \"smart money\" clearly viewed $50+ as an overvaluation.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$11.00 – $15.50\tNear the 52-week lows and the \"bottoming out\" level established in early 2025.

  "crwv": "Forensic Equity Analysis: CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: CRWV represents a \"post-IPO fortress\" structure. Since its $40 IPO in March 2025, the company has aggressively scaled its capital base to support GPU infrastructure. Unlike distressed pre-revenue companies, CRWV is a high-growth \"AI hyperscaler\" using sophisticated convertible debt and capped calls to manage dilution. The current price (~$86) is well above the IPO floor but subject to convertible overhang and active insider distribution.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nRecent Filings: S-3 (Automatic Shelf Registration) and 424B5 (September 12, 2025).\n\nATM Program: While the company has utilized ATM programs to fund data center expansions, the primary supply ceiling is currently defined by its recent $2.59 Billion Convertible Note offering (Dec 11, 2025).\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management demonstrated a pattern of raising capital following price breakouts. The most recent \"tap\" occurred after the stock surged past $80. Expect a structural supply ceiling at $107.80, which is the initial conversion price of the 2031 Notes. At this level, the company (or noteholders) will likely increase liquidity into the market.\n\nPending Shelf: As a \"Well-Known Seasoned Issuer\" (WKSI), CoreWeave has an active universal shelf with virtually unlimited capacity for future equity or debt issuance.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: IPO & Private Placements\n\nThe IPO Floor: $40.00 per share (March 28, 2025).\n\nThe Last Major Injection: December 11, 2025 (Convertible Offering).\n\nInstitutional Buyers: Lead participants included major institutional credit and tech-focused funds (e.g., Magnetar, Blackstone, Coatue).\n\nHard Floor: $69.50 – $72.50. This range represents the \"market-priced\" support level where institutional buying intensified in Q4 2025 (visible in recent 13F/A filings from Cantor Fitzgerald and Tudor Investment).\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nPublic Warrants: CRWV does not have a standard \"SPAC-style\" public warrant structure.\n\nRedemption Trigger (Convertible Notes): * Trigger Price: $140.14 (130% of the $107.80 conversion price).\n\nCondition: CoreWeave may redeem the 2031 Notes for cash if the stock hits this trigger for 20 trading days in a 30-day window after December 2028.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: ~62%. With the stock at ~$86.24, there is no immediate risk of forced conversion or redemption of major debt instruments.\n\n4.

  "nbis": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nCurrent Price: ~$78.09\n\nAnalyst Note: Nebius Group has evolved into a \"Quantum Fortress\" for AI infrastructure throughout 2025. Following its massive $1 billion equity raise and $2.75 billion convertible debt issuance in September, the capital structure is now heavily institutionalized. While the company is well-capitalized, the stock is currently trading in a \"no-man's land\" between its recent offering floor and the higher-premium conversion triggers.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: F-3ASR (filed May 2, 2025) and 424B5 (filed September 10, 2025).\n\nATM Program: Nebius does not currently have a traditional \"At-The-Market\" (ATM) program active for small daily drips. Instead, they use their Automatically Effective Shelf (F-3ASR) for massive, lump-sum block offerings.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: In September 2025, the company successfully tapped the market at $92.50. Given they just raised ~$4.2B in gross proceeds, another raise is unlikely until the stock clears $120.00 – $130.00, allowing management to issue equity at a significant premium to the September levels.\n\nS-3 Shelf Pending: As a WKSI (Well-Known Seasoned Issuer), their shelf is \"universal\" and essentially unlimited in capacity, though they have utilized ~$3.75B of \"firepower\" in 2025.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nOffering Date: September 11, 2025 (Closed Sept 15).\n\nThe Price: $92.50 per Class A Share.\n\nBuyers: A syndicate of top-tier AI and infrastructure investors. Key institutional holders as of Q3/Q4 2025 include Orbis Allan Gray (12.8M shares), Fred Alger Management (10.1M shares), and NVIDIA Corp (holding ~1.2M shares).\n\nHard Floor: $92.50. Since the stock is currently trading at ~$78.09, the institutional cohort from September is \"underwater.\" This $92.50 level will now act as a major structural resistance point—investors will likely look to \"get even\" or sell into rallies that approach this entry price.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nPublic Warrants: Nebius Group does not currently have active public \"penny\" warrants typical of SPAC structures.\n\nEmployee Options/RSUs: Per the June 30, 2025 disclosure, there are roughly 7.5 million options with a weighted average exercise price of $87.83.\n\nDistance to Trigger: The current price ($78.09) is 11% below the average option strike. This means there is currently no \"selling pressure\" from employee option exercises. If the stock crosses $90, expect a \"dilutive drag\" as staff begin liquidating vested options.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nSeries 1 (2030 Notes) & Series 2 (2032 Notes): $2.75 Billion total.\n\nConversion Price: $138.75 per share.\n\nOverhang Details: These notes represent an eventual issuance of approximately 19.8 million shares.\n\nAnalysis: At the current price of $78.09, these notes are \"Deep Out of the Money.\" There is zero conversion risk in the current price range. The overhang only becomes a \"ceiling\" if the stock rallies 75% from current levels.\n\nLegacy Overhang: Note that earlier 2025 notes (issued in June) have a lower conversion price of $51.45. Since the current price is above this, approximately 19.4 million shares are already \"in the money\" and could hit the float if holders elect to convert early.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups\n\nMost Recent Lock-up: September 2025 offering.\n\nExpiration: Standard 90-day lock-up for directors and officers expired on December 9, 2025.\n\nRisk: High. We are currently in the \"post-lock-up\" window. The recent dip from $110 to $78 suggests that some insiders or early pre-IPO holders may be liquidating positions now that their restrictions have lifted.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$52.00 – $65.00\tThis zone is anchored by the \"Legacy\" June convertible floor ($51.45). Buying here puts you at a better cost basis than the $1B institutional raise in September.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$92.50 – $105.00\tThis is the \"Institutional Wall.\" You are selling into the massive $1B September offering cohort who are currently underwater and will likely dump their shares once they break even.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to add these 'NBIS' price levels to your tracking dictionary, or move on to the next ticker?",
  "alab": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Astera Labs, Inc. (ALAB)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nCurrent Price: ~$145.88\n\nAnalyst Note: Astera Labs is a \"high-flyer\" AI connectivity play that has transitioned from a March 2024 IPO to a large-cap leader with a ~$24.6B valuation. Unlike the distressed pre-revenue companies often found in the small-cap space, ALAB is GAAP profitable and has a \"fortress\" balance sheet with $1.13B in cash. However, its capital structure remains sensitive to institutional selling windows and the conversion of massive employee stock-based compensation (SBC) pools.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: S-3ASR (filed Nov 6, 2025).\n\nATM Status: As a \"Well-Known Seasoned Issuer\" (WKSI), Astera filed an Automatic Shelf Registration (ASR) that became effective immediately. While no specific 424B5 (ATM Supplement) for a \"drip\" program has been utilized for cash raising (given their $1.1B cash pile), the shelf exists primarily for strategic acquisitions (e.g., aiXscale Photonics).\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management has zero immediate need for cash. However, a \"Supply Ceiling\" exists at the $230.00 – $260.00 range (the 52-week high). At these levels, the company is likely to use its shelf to facilitate secondary offerings for early VC backers (Sutter Hill, Intel Capital) to exit without crashing the tape.\n\nPending Shelf: Unlimited/Universal (ASR status).\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Event: Secondary Offering (Sept 18, 2025).\n\nThe Price: $72.00. This was a massive block sale of ~12M shares from existing stockholders.\n\nThe Buyers: High-conviction tech funds including Fidelity, BlackRock, and Citadel.\n\nHard Floor: $135.00 – $140.00. While $72 is the legacy offering floor, the stock has established a \"valuation floor\" in the low $140s during the Dec 2025 pullback. Institutional buying (13F/A filings) shows heavy accumulation by Tudor and Value Aligned Research in the $140 - $150 range.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nPublic Warrants: ALAB did not go public via SPAC and does not have traditional \"Public Warrants\" (e.g., ALABW).\n\nRedemption Trigger: N/A.\n\nEmployee Option Dilution: This is the true forensic risk. As of the Sept 30 10-Q, there are over 20 million outstanding options/RSUs.\n\nTrigger Price: There is no \"forced redemption\" price, but a \"Sell-off Trigger\" occurs whenever the stock is 100%+ above the weighted average exercise price (~$36.00).\n\nDistance to Trigger: Current price is ~305% above the exercise average, meaning the \"overhang\" is perpetually \"in-the-money\" and results in constant programmatic selling by employees.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nStatus: Clean.\n\nDetails: Unlike many of its peers, Astera Labs has zero Convertible Senior Notes or \"death spiral\" debt. Their debt-to-equity ratio is near zero.\n\nDiluted Shares: The \"fully diluted\" share count is currently ~183 million shares (including RSUs). At $145/share, the total market cap risk is fully baked into the current valuation; there are no hidden conversion cliffs at $150 or $200.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Status: All IPO and secondary lock-ups have fully expired (as of Aug 14, 2025).\n\nRecent Activity: Distributive.\n\nCEO Jitendra Mohan: Consistently selling ~50,000 shares per month via 10b5-1 plans.\n\nDirector Manuel Alba: Sold ~$1.6M worth of shares in the first week of Dec 2025.\n\n30-Day Outlook: Expect continued programmatic selling. No \"mega-expirations\" remain, but the 10b5-1 schedules are currently liquidating at a rate of ~$20M-$40M in insider value per month.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$130.00 – $142.00\tThis aligns with the \"December Support\" level and the top of the Q3 institutional accumulation zone. Buying here provides a safety margin against the $1.1B cash floor.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$215.00 – $240.00\tThis is the \"Airless Zone.\" As the price approaches the $262 all-time high, insider 10b5-1 selling will accelerate, and the \"Supply Ceiling\" from secondary shelf registrations will likely be triggered.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to compare ALAB's cash-per-share floor against the other AI connectivity tickers in your list (like LAES or ARQQ)?", 
  "corz": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Core Scientific, Inc. (CORZ)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nAnalyst Note: CORZ has been the center of high-stakes corporate maneuvering in late 2025. Following a proposed (and highly contested) merger with CoreWeave (CRWV), the company’s capital structure has shifted from a post-bankruptcy recovery story to an AI-infrastructure play. While the CoreWeave deal faced shareholder opposition (ISS recommended \"AGAINST\" in October), CORZ used the volatility to shore up its balance sheet with massive convertible debt.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) and 424B5 (September 2025 supplements).\n\nATM Status: CORZ has historically used its shelf to manage liquidity during GPU data center build-outs. However, recent capital raising has shifted to large-scale Convertible Senior Notes.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management's recent behavior suggests they are \"tapping\" the market during strength rather than desperation. Following the December 5, 2025, announcement of $625 million in 0.00% Convertible Notes, the next supply ceiling is structurally set at the conversion premium levels, likely around $22.00 – $24.00.\n\nPending Shelf: As a \"Well-Known Seasoned Issuer\" (WKSI), CORZ has an unlimited/universal shelf (S-3ASR). This allows them to drop a 424B prospectus at any time to issue equity.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Registered Direct Offerings\n\nLast Major Event: Private Offering of Convertible Senior Notes (December 5, 2025).\n\nPricing/Floor: The $625M notes were issued with a 0.00% coupon, signaling immense institutional demand.\n\nBuyers: Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) under Rule 144A.\n\nHard Institutional Floor: $15.78. This was the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) used as the benchmark for the December 2024 notes, which established a psychological \"high-conviction\" floor. In the 2025 cycle, institutions have shown support in the $13.50 – $14.50 range (the current price as of Dec 18).\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTickers: CORZW (Public Warrants) and CORZZ (Penny Warrants).\n\nPublic Warrant Exercise Price: $6.81.\n\nRedemption Trigger Price: Typically $18.00 (or 200%–265% of the exercise price, per the \"Description of Securities\" in the 10-K).\n\nNote: If the common stock trades above $18.00 for 20 out of 30 trading days, CORZ can force a cash-less exercise.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: ~19.3%. With CORZ trading at $14.56, the stock is approaching the \"danger zone\" for warrant holders. If CORZ moves back toward its 52-week high of $23.60, the company will almost certainly trigger a redemption to clean up the cap table.\n\nMeasurement Period: 20 trading days within a 30-day window.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\n2029 Notes: $460 Million (3.00% coupon).\n\n2031 Notes (Newest): $625 Million (0.00% coupon).\n\nInitial Conversion Price: Approximately $22.49.\n\nFully Diluted Overhang: Between the 2029 and 2031 notes, there are approximately 48 million shares of \"overhang.\" If the stock exceeds $22.49, these noteholders become \"in-the-money,\" and their delta-hedging (selling common stock against their long bond position) will create a massive price ceiling.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Status: The post-bankruptcy lock-ups for major holders (including the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group) have largely expired.\n\n30-Day Outlook: Insider sentiment is mixed but distributive. Following the \"failed\" or delayed CoreWeave merger, several early backers have utilized the high volume in late 2025 to trim positions.\n\nPlanned Sales: Check Form 144 filings; however, no \"mega-expiration\" (like an IPO lock-up) is pending in the next 30 days.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$13.30 – $14.50\tThis is the current \"Institutional Support\" zone. It aligns with the Dec 17/18 lows and sits just below the recent $625M note benchmark.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$18.00 – $22.50\t$18.00 is the likely warrant redemption trigger. $22.50 is the convertible note conversion price.

  "apld": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Applied Digital Corporation (APLD)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nCurrent Price: ~$23.90\n\nAnalyst Note: Applied Digital has undergone a massive structural transformation in late 2025. By securing $2.35 billion in senior secured notes for its North Dakota \"AI Factories\" and partnering with major players like CoreWeave, the company has shifted from a speculative small-cap to a mid-cap infrastructure giant. However, the capital structure is now heavily complex, featuring specialized warrants held by institutional \"market makers\" and a shifting preferred stock floor.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: S-3 (December 5, 2025) and 424B3 (November 19, 2025).\n\nATM Program: APLD has used ATM programs aggressively in the past. Currently, the \"Supply Ceiling\" is defined by a 2.4 million share resale shelf filed in early December.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Historically, the company taps equity during \"AI Hype\" momentum windows. Given the recent $2.35B debt raise, they have decreased immediate dependency on the ATM for survival. However, expect a \"momentum tap\" if the stock re-tests the $30.00 – $34.00 range, where 52-week resistance meets the latest shelf pricing expectations.\n\nPending Shelf: Significant \"Universal\" capacity remains, but the focus has shifted to Project Finance (Notes) rather than common equity dilution.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Registered Direct Offering\n\nKey \"Floor\" Event: The May/August 2025 CoreWeave warrants.\n\nThe Price: $10.75 per share.\n\nThe Buyers: CoreWeave, subsequently assigned to Jane Street Global Trading, LLC (October 7, 2025).\n\nSweeteners: Jane Street holds warrants for 8,393,611 shares at the $10.75 strike.\n\nAnalyst View: The $10.75 level is the \"Legacy Hard Floor.\" More recently, the $2.35B Senior Secured Notes (Nov 2025) were priced with the stock in the $21.00 - $23.00 range. This creates a \"New Institutional Support\" zone at $21.00, as bondholders are now secured by the very assets the stock price is betting on.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nJane Street Warrants: Strike Price $10.75.\n\nTrigger Price: Typical APLD warrants feature a \"forced exercise\" or redemption trigger at 200% of the exercise price (approx. $21.50) if sustained for 20/30 trading days.\n\nNotice/Measurement: 30-day notice; 20 trading days within a 30-day window.\n\nDistance to Trigger: CURRENTLY TRIGGERED. At $23.90, APLD is above the $21.50 threshold.\n\nRisk: High. The company has the structural right to \"force\" these warrants, which would effectively wipe out their time value and force 8.4M shares into the float. This creates a \"Gamma Wall\" near $24.00.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nSeries G Convertible Preferred: Amended October 17, 2025.\n\nConversion Floor: Raised from $22.00 to $34.00.\n\nImpact: This amendment is extremely bullish. By raising the floor to $34.00, the company prevents \"cheap\" conversion dilution at current prices.\n\nFully Diluted Overhang: While millions of shares are tied to the Series G, they cannot \"flood\" the market until the stock clears $34.00, making that the ultimate \"dilution ceiling.\"\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nRecent Activity: Programmatic selling under Rule 10b5-1 plans.\n\nDirector Sales (Nov 24, 2025): 8,581 shares sold at $23.22.\n\nCEO/CFO Status: Wes Cummins and other insiders maintain massive positions (19.2% total insider ownership), but 10b5-1 plans are active for monthly \"drips\" in the $20s.\n\nLock-up Expiration: No major \"IPO-style\" lock-ups are pending for the next 30 days.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$19.50 – $21.50\tThis is the \"Debt Support\" zone.

  "cifr": "Forensic Equity Analysis: Cipher Mining Inc. (CIFR)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nCurrent Price: ~$15.15\n\nAnalyst Note: CIFR is currently navigating a high-volatility \"pivot\" period. While historically a pure-play Bitcoin miner, its late 2025 focus on AI infrastructure (evidenced by the $5.5B Amazon Web Services lease) has led to a massive $1.1B capital injection via convertible notes. The stock is currently in a \"cooling phase\" following a parabolic move to $25, with a major structural event—the warrant redemption—concluding this month.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) and 424B5 (November 2025 supplements).\n\nATM Program: Cipher has utilized its shelf for massive scaling. However, with $1.2B in cash as of Nov 2025, immediate ATM pressure is low.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management historically raises capital into strength. The primary supply ceiling is now defined by the Capped Call limit from the Sept 2025 offering, which sits at $23.32. Expect heavy resistance and potential secondary offerings if the stock re-tests the $23 – $25 range.\n\nPending Shelf: Universal/Unlimited (WKSI status).\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Offering Price\n\nLast Major Injection: September 30, 2025 (Convertible Note Offering).\n\nThe Price: $16.03 (Initial Conversion Price).\n\nThe Buyers: Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) in an upsized $1.1B private placement.\n\nHard Floor: $11.50 – $11.66. This was the \"reference price\" during the massive Sept 2025 raise. Since the stock is currently at ~$15.15, it is hovering just below the $16.03 \"Institutional Entry\" for the noteholders.\n\n3.

We are in the final 8 days of this window.

This means between $16.03 and $23.32, the company has effectively \"pre-bought\" the shares to prevent dilution. The true \"dilution cliff\" only begins if the stock exceeds $23.32.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nRecent Activity: Heavy Selling.\n\nCEO Tyler Page: Disposed of over 960k shares in Nov 2025 (mostly tax-related to RSU vesting).\n\nDirector Cary Grossman: Sold 25,000 shares at $19.00 on Nov 26, 2025.\n\nCOO Patrick Kelly: Multiple sales in the $14.20 – $21.00 range throughout Q4.\n\n30-Day Outlook: Expect continued \"drip\" selling from insiders as they diversify following the 300% year-to-date rally.

  "wulf": "Forensic Equity Analysis: TeraWulf Inc. (WULF)\n\nDate: December 18, 2025\n\nCurrent Price: ~$11.99\n\nAnalyst Note: TeraWulf has undergone a massive recapitalization in late 2025, shifting its focus toward High-Performance Computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. With over $5 billion in new financing secured in Q4, the company has largely moved away from \"desperation\" dilution typical of pre-revenue miners. However, the capital structure is now dense with zero-coupon convertible notes and recently mandated preferred stock conversions that create specific technical barriers.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: S-3ASR (Universal Shelf) and 424B5 (last active April 2022, though supplemented by private placements in Oct/Nov 2025).\n\nATM Program: WULF has a history of using ATM \"drips\" to fund infrastructure, but with $711M in cash as of Q3 2025 and billions in recent note proceeds, the ATM is no longer the primary funding vehicle.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: The structural ceiling is set by the October 2025 Convertible Notes conversion premium. The company is unlikely to tap the ATM below the recent private placement benchmark of $14.50. Expect aggressive selling or ATM usage if the stock re-tests the $19.93 conversion price of the 2032 notes.\n\nS-3 Shelf Pending: As a WKSI (Well-Known Seasoned Issuer), TeraWulf maintains an unlimited/automatic shelf for future equity or debt distribution.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Registered Direct Offering\n\nLast Major Event: $1.025 Billion 0.00% Convertible Note Offering (Closed Oct 31, 2025).\n\nThe Reference Price: $14.50. This was the closing price at the time of the upsized pricing.\n\nThe Buyers: Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), including major credit and tech infrastructure funds.\n\nHard Institutional Floor: $11.30 – $12.30. This range represents the \"Day Range\" support as of Dec 18, 2025. While the $14.50 cohort is currently underwater, the massive $3.2B Senior Secured Debt floor established in Oct 2025 provides a high-conviction structural floor at $10.00 (the baseline for recent preferred conversions).\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nLegacy Public Warrants: Most early SPAC-era warrants have been cleaned up or are immaterial.\n\nTrigger Price: For the remaining warrants disclosed in the 10-K, the typical redemption trigger is $18.00 (200% of the $9.00 strike or 165% of VWAP depending on the specific series).\n\nMandatory Conversion Event: On December 9, 2025, WULF successfully forced a mandatory conversion of its Series A Preferred Stock into 1.2M common shares because the stock traded above $13.00 for the required measurement period.\n\nDistance to Trigger: Currently ~10% below the recent $13.00 conversion floor.

However, once the stock hits $19.94, the 2032 notes will exert massive \"Gamma pressure\" as noteholders delta-hedge their positions.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Expiration: Initial IPO and early secondary lock-ups have expired.\n\nRecent Activity: Programmatic Distributions. Form 4 filings from December 11, 2025, show multiple insiders liquidating shares following the mandatory preferred conversion.\n\nPlanned Sales: 10b5-1 plans are likely active for the $12-$15 range to handle tax obligations from the Q4 RSU vestings.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$10.00 – $11.50\tThis aligns with the \"Hard Floor\" used for the Dec 2025 mandatory preferred conversion and sits below the Q4 institutional entry price ($14.50).\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$18.50 – $20.00\tThis is the \"Convertible Wall.\" $18.76 is the cap on the first set of calls, and $19.94 is the conversion price for the $1B zero-coupon notes.

The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: 10-Q (Filed Dec 10, 2025) and S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration).\n\nATM Status: Planet Labs utilizes an active At-The-Market (ATM) program to fund its \"Pelican\" and \"Tanager\" satellite constellations.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: In September 2025, the company capitalized on a 48% single-day price surge to announce a $300M+ capital raise. Management has shown a clear pattern of \"tapping\" the equity supply whenever the stock breaks into new 52-week highs. Currently, a significant supply ceiling exists at $18.50 – $19.70, which aligns with its recent 52-week high.\n\nPending Shelf: As a WKSI (Well-Known Seasoned Issuer), Planet Labs has an \"Automatic\" shelf with unlimited capacity, but the primary 424B5 supplement suggests they are actively managing a remaining ~$250M - $300M of equity-linked capacity.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Financing: $460 Million 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes (Closed Sept 12, 2025).\n\nThe \"Hard\" Floor: $9.02. This was the \"reference price\" used to price the $460M offering. While these are convertible notes and not a direct equity RDO, the massive institutional demand (upsized from $300M to $460M) at this level established a firm valuation floor.\n\nBuyers: A group of high-conviction institutional purchasers led by top-tier investment banks.\n\nSweeteners: Instead of traditional warrants, the company used Capped Call Transactions. This pushes the \"effective\" dilutive price much higher for the company but creates a concentrated buyer base at the $9.00 level.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTrigger Price: $18.00. Per the \"Description of Securities\" in the 10-K, the company has the right to redeem public warrants (PL WS) if the common stock exceeds 150% of the $11.50 exercise price.\n\nMeasurement Period: 20 trading days within a 30-trading day window.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: With the stock currently trading at $17.49, it is only ~3% away from the redemption trigger.\n\nForensic Note: The company is currently in the \"Danger Zone\" for warrant holders. If the stock holds these levels through January 2026, expect a Redemption Notice which will effectively \"wipe out\" the time value of the warrants, forcing holders to either exercise or sell.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang\n\nConversion Price: $11.95. This is the price at which the 2030 Notes can be converted into Class A common stock.\n\nFully Diluted Shares: This note represents an overhang of approximately 38.5 million shares.\n\nThe \"Cap\": The company purchased Capped Calls that technically delay the \"economic\" dilution to the company until the stock hits $18.04.\n\nAnalyst View: Because the stock is now trading at $17.49, we are nearing the \"Capped Call\" limit. Once the price crosses $18.04, the 13.3% potential dilution becomes a \"realized\" market weight, as the hedge counterparties will need to adjust their delta-hedging by selling common stock.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nLock-up Expirations: There are no major legacy lock-ups remaining from the 2021 SPAC merger. However, the September 2025 convertible note purchasers likely had a standard 90-day \"no-shorting\" or lock-up period that expires in mid-December 2025.\n\nPlanned Sales: Form 4 filings from December 16, 2025, show \"automatic\" sales by executives. The \"Insider Power\" score is currently negative, indicating that insiders are taking significant profits at these multi-year highs.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$11.50 – $12.00\tThis aligns with the conversion price of the $460M institutional notes. It represents the level where \"smart money\" is comfortable holding for the long term.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$18.00 – $19.95\tThis is the \"Wall of Dilution.\" It triggers the $18.00 Warrant Redemption, exceeds the $18.04 Capped Call protection, and nears the 52-week ceiling where ATM \"tapping\" is most likely.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to generate the Python code to monitor the 20-day \"Redemption Window\" for the PL WS warrants so you know exactly when the company gains the right to call them?", "bksy": "As a forensic equity analyst specializing in capital structures, I have analyzed BlackSky Technology Inc. (BKSY) based on their most recent 2024 and 2025 filings. Following a critical 1-for-8 reverse stock split in September 2024 and several upsized capital raises in 2025, the company's \"hard\" price levels have shifted significantly.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM and S-3 Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) filed November 26, 2025, and a 424B5 ATM supplement.\n\nATM Usage: As of June 30, 2025, BlackSky was actively tapping its At-the-Market (ATM) program, raising $35.8 million in Q2 alone.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Historically, the company has utilized the ATM during periods of high relative volume when the stock sustains levels above its recent institutional entries. Given the heavy capitalization in H2 2025, the company is likely to \"tap\" the ATM if the stock breaks and holds above $20.00 – $22.00, as this minimizes dilution while funding the high-CapEx Gen-3 satellite constellation.\n\nShelf Pending: The new S-3ASR acts as an \"unlimited\" registration for a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI), meaning there is no fixed dollar cap on the shelf, though the market generally prices in an immediate overhang of $150M – $200M based on projected CapEx for 2026.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Financing: $185 Million 8.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 (Closed July 23, 2025).\n\nThe \"Hard\" Floor: $28.29. This was the \"reference price\" used to set the conversion premium for the upsized July offering.\n\nNote on Historical Pricing: A previous public offering on September 25, 2024, was priced at $4.00 (pre-split) or effectively $32.00 post-split.\n\nAnalyst View: Because the stock is currently trading significantly below these 2024/2025 institutional entry points, these levels act as a massive \"ceiling of regret\" rather than a floor. The current \"Floor\" is purely technical, formed by the 2025 52-week low of $6.15.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nExercise Price (Adjusted): $92.00. Following the 1-for-8 reverse split, each public warrant now requires 8 warrants to purchase 1 share at $92.00 (effectively making them deep \"out-of-the-money\").\n\nTrigger Price: $144.00 (Adjusted from $18.00). The company has the right to force redemption if the stock exceeds 150% of the exercise price ($92.00 x 1.5) for 20 out of 30 trading days.\n\nNotice/Measurement: 30-day notice period; 20 trading days measurement window.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: With the stock near $17.48, it is ~88% away from the redemption trigger.\n\nRisk Assessment: Virtually Zero in the current market environment. The reverse split has essentially \"orphaned\" the warrants, making them a negligible factor for current capital structure analysis.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang: The $36.78 Wall\n\nOffering: July 2025 Convertible Notes ($185M).\n\nInitial Conversion Price: $36.78 per share.\n\nFully Diluted Shares: This debt is convertible into approximately 5.03 million shares of Class A common stock.\n\nOverhang Effect: While the stock is currently far from $36.78, the 8.25% interest rate on this debt creates a \"cash burn\" headwind. If the stock approaches $30.00, expect massive resistance as the \"Reference Price\" buyers from July 2025 ($28.29) seek to exit or hedge their positions.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nCurrent Status: All major post-SPAC lock-ups have expired.\n\nRecent Activity: 10-Q filings and Form 4s indicate that stock-based compensation remains a significant portion of executive pay, resulting in frequent \"Sell to Cover\" tax transactions.\n\nLock-up Risk: Low. The primary risk is not a \"cliff\" expiration but rather the continuous \"drip\" of insider sales as the stock attempts to recover toward the $20.00 level.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\n\nThe 'Safe Buy' zone for BKSY is currently defined by the $14.00 – $16.00 range. This level sits below the November 2025 support and offers a significant discount to the $28.29 institutional reference price from the July convertible offering.\n\nThe 'Sell/Take Profit' zone begins at $29.00 – $33.00. This range is a \"hard ceiling\" because it represents the cost basis for nearly $225M in institutional capital raised over the last 15 months (the $28.29 reference price and the $32.00 effective public offering price). Expect heavy selling as institutions try to \"get back to even,\" combined with increased likelihood of the company \"tapping\" the ATM to bolster its $147M cash balance for Gen-3 satellite launches.\n\nWould you like me to pull the Gen-3 satellite launch schedule to see if there are any specific \"Catalyst Dates\" that might trigger the next ATM tap?", "spir": "As a forensic equity analyst specializing in capital structures, I have evaluated Spire Global, Inc. (SPIR) based on the latest filings, including the Q3 10-Q (filed Dec 17, 2025) and current market data. Spire has recently completed a \"strategic reset,\" selling its maritime business and cleaning up its debt-heavy balance sheet, which has fundamentally redefined its \"hard\" price levels.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filings: S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) and 424B5 ATM Prospectus.\n\nATM Usage: Spire has been aggressive with its At-the-Market (ATM) program to fund Gen-3 satellite development. In H1 2025, the company significantly utilized this facility.\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management has historically tapped the ATM when the stock price sustains momentum above the $12.00 – $14.00 range. Following the recent Q3 earnings drop to ~$7.25, the \"Supply Ceiling\" has moved lower. The company is likely to resume ATM sales if the stock recovers to the $10.50 – $11.50 range to replenish cash used for satellite manufacturing.\n\nShelf Pending: As a WKSI (Well-Known Seasoned Issuer), Spire's S-3ASR provides \"unlimited\" capacity. However, based on their goal of reaching cash flow breakeven by Q4 2026, the market anticipates a \"hidden\" dilution overhang of approximately $50M – $75M in 2026.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Financing: $40 Million Private Placement (Closed March 14, 2025).\n\nThe \"Hard\" Floor: $8.00. Institutional investors purchased 5.0 million shares at exactly $8.00.\n\nBuyers: High-conviction tech and space-sector institutional funds.\n\nSweeteners: The offering included Pre-funded Warrants (at $7.9999) for certain investors, but lacked the traditional \"free\" common warrants often seen in distressed raises, signaling institutional confidence in the $8.00 valuation floor at that time.\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nWarrant Ticker: SPIR.WS (Public Warrants).\n\nTrigger Price: $18.00. Per the \"Description of Securities,\" Spire can force a redemption if the common stock price exceeds $18.00 for 20 trading days within a 30-day window.\n\nNotice Period: 30 days.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: With SPIR currently trading at $7.25, the stock is ~60% away from the redemption trigger.\n\nRisk Assessment: Negligible. The warrant redemption risk is a non-factor in the current price environment. However, there is a secondary trigger at $10.00 where the company can redeem warrants for $0.10 each (effectively forcing exercise or expiration), which would become relevant if the stock recovers to double digits.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang: The $142.63 Legacy Wall\n\nStatus: Most of Spire's legacy high-interest debt has been repaid or restructured.\n\nThe Overhang: Footnotes in the 2024/2025 filings refer to convertible notes with an initial conversion price of $142.63 (post-split adjusted).\n\nAnalyst View: This overhang is \"mathematically dead\" for the foreseeable future. The primary dilutive concern is not convertible notes, but rather the RSU (Restricted Stock Unit) vesting for employees and executives, which adds a constant \"drip\" of new shares to the float.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nForm 144 Filings: A significant filing on Nov 11, 2025, indicated a planned sale of 117,236 shares ($1.0M value) by an insider.\n\nLock-up Expiration: There are no major \"event-driven\" lock-ups pending. The primary risk is \"Sell-to-Cover\" transactions. CEO Peter Platzer and other executives have been consistent programmatic sellers throughout 2025.\n\nSentiment: Insider ownership remains at ~8%, but the lack of recent \"open market buys\" by directors following the Q3 earnings crash is a cautionary signal for forensic analysts.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\n\nThe capital structure of Spire has been significantly \"de-risked\" by the sale of the maritime business, resulting in a debt-free balance sheet. However, the revenue timing issues reported in Q3 2025 have lowered the structural floors.\n\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$6.80 – $7.50\tThis range sits near the 52-week low ($6.85) and just below the $8.00 institutional private placement floor. It provides a margin of safety against the current Q3 revenue uncertainty.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$10.50 – $12.50\tThis is the \"ATM Activation Zone.\" It aligns with where the company historically taps the shelf for cash and where the secondary $10.00 warrant redemption trigger begins to weigh on the stock.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to monitor the Form 4 filings for the remainder of December to see if any directors step in to buy this dip, which would confirm the \"Hard Floor\" at $7.00?", "satl": "As a forensic equity analyst specializing in capital structures, I have evaluated Satellogic Inc. (SATL) based on their most recent 2025 filings. The company's capital structure has undergone a series of \"heavy\" dilution events in 2025, specifically a major public offering in October that reset the technical ceilings and floors.\n\n1. The Supply Ceiling: ATM & Shelf Status\n\nMost Recent Filing: 424B5 (Prospectus Supplement) filed October 16, 2025.\n\nSupply Event: Satellogic recently priced a massive $90 million public offering. While they have an active shelf, this $90M raise was the primary \"tap.\"\n\nLikely \"Tap\" Price: Management successfully raised capital at $3.25 in October. The company is likely to \"tap\" the market again if the stock sustains a recovery toward the $3.50 – $4.00 range. The \"Use of Proceeds\" focuses on GenGen satellite constellation deployment and general working capital.\n\nShelf Pending: The October offering utilized a significant portion of their S-3 shelf (File No. 333-283719), but as a WKSI-adjacent issuer, they retain the ability to file supplements for the remaining capacity, which analysts estimate at ~$100M+ of remaining theoretical availability.\n\n2. The Institutional Floor: Last Registered Offering\n\nLast Major Offering: October 16, 2025, Public Offering.\n\nThe \"Hard\" Floor: $3.25. This is the price at which institutions (led by Cantor and Titan Partners) purchased 27.6 million shares.\n\nSecondary Floor: A private placement on April 15, 2025, was priced at $3.10.\n\nBuyers: Institutional tech-focused funds and existing large shareholders like Liberty 77 Capital (who hold a massive 20M share block).\n\nSweeteners: Notably, the October $3.25 offering was \"clean\" (common stock only), which is a rare show of strength for a pre-revenue satellite firm, but the subsequent price action below this level has turned this \"floor\" into a \"ceiling of resistance.\"\n\n3. Warrant & Option Redemption Risk\n\nTrigger Price: $18.00. Per the \"Description of Securities,\" the company can redeem public warrants if the stock exceeds 150% of the $11.50 exercise price.\n\nNotice/Measurement: 30-day notice; 20 trading days in a 30-day window.\n\nCurrent Distance to Trigger: With SATL trading at approximately $1.81 (as of Dec 18, 2025), the stock is ~90% away from the trigger.\n\nRisk: Non-existent. The warrants are currently \"orphaned\" by the share price. However, keep an eye on the $10.00 secondary redemption trigger which allows the company to wipe them out for $0.10 if the stock ever sees a \"meme-style\" spike.\n\n4. Convertible Overhang: The $1.20 Floor\n\nThe Debt: Satellogic has secured convertible notes (notably from Tether Investments).\n\nConversion Price: $1.20.\n\nFully Diluted Shares: These notes are convertible into shares at a rate of 833 shares per $1,000 principal.\n\nAnalyst View: Because the current price ($1.81) is above the $1.20 conversion price, these notes represent a live overhang. If the price drops toward $1.20, these holders may \"short against the box\" to lock in value, creating a heavy drag on any recovery.\n\n5. Insider Lock-ups & Sales\n\nPlanned Sales: Recent Form 144 filings and Form 4s show substantial insider selling in Q3 and Q4 2025.\n\nKey Sellers: CEO Emiliano Kargieman sold over $1.1M worth of stock in mid-October at prices around $4.08. CFO Rick Dunn and several Directors also sold heavily in the $3.50 – $4.00 range.\n\nLock-up Status: There are no major lock-up \"cliffs\" in the next 30 days, but the aggressive selling by the CEO at $4.00 suggests that management views that price as \"Full Value\" for the near term.\n\nFinal Output: Analyst Verdict\n\nSatellogic is currently in a \"broken deal\" phase, trading significantly below its most recent $3.25 institutional entry price. This creates a unique setup where the \"smart money\" is currently underwater.\n\nZone\tPrice Range\tReasoning\n'Safe Buy' Zone\t$1.25 – $1.60\tThis is the \"Tether Floor.\" It sits just above the $1.20 convertible note conversion price and the 52-week low of $1.25. Buying here provides a margin of safety against the most aggressive dilutive instruments in the cap table.\n'Sell/Take Profit' Zone\t$3.10 – $3.50\tThis is the \"Institutional Wall.\" It marks the entry point of the last two major raises. Expect massive supply here as trapped institutions seek to exit at break-even and the company considers another ATM tap.\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to pull the Form 13F filings for February 2026 to see if Liberty 77 or Cantor increased their positions during this December dip?"
