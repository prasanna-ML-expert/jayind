The gamma flip, an estimated volatility pivot, is around $8.75, close to the current stock price of approximately $8.86 [cite: 4 from previous search, 10 from previous search, 28 from previous search]. A robust put wall is situated at the $8.00 strike, where a significant amount of put open interest acts as a hard floor.

The gamma flip is estimated around $15.50, reflecting the current trading range and areas of significant options activity near the stock's approximate price of $15.43. The put wall, serving as a hard floor, is found at the $14.00 strike with notable put open interest. The max pain point for this expiration is $15.00 [cite: 28 from previous search].\n*   **LEAPS (January 15, 2027):** For Joby Aviation LEAPS expiring in January 2027, detailed strike-specific open interest for call walls, put walls, and gamma flip is not available and thus marked as 0.

With the current stock price around $3.985 [cite: 7 from previous search], the gamma flip is estimated at $4.00.

While older Reddit posts from September 2025 mentioned call walls around $120-$140, and a June 2025 article indicated a \"$180\u2013$185 resistance zone\", these are not current for the nearest monthly expiration as of January 2026.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. A Reddit post from September 2025 discussed a \"gamma-flip zone\" without providing a current numerical value relevant to the nearest expiration.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. Older Reddit discussions from September 2025 mentioned put walls around $100-$110, but this is not current for the nearest monthly expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. An older Reddit post from September 2025 cited Max Pain at approximately $125 for a specific expiration, which is not current.\n\n*   **NBIS (Nebius Group N.V.)**:\n    *   **Call Wall Upside Barrier**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. A Reddit post from January 2025 indicated a \"major call wall\" at the $40 strike and resistance at $38, but this information is dated.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. A Reddit post from January 2025 suggested a potential \"gamma squeeze at 40,\" implying a gamma flip around that level at the time, but this is outdated.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n\n*   **CORZ (Core Scientific Inc.)**:\n    *   **Call Wall Upside Barrier**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n\n*   **APLD (Applied Digital Corp)**:\n    *   **Call Wall Upside Barrier**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. A YouTube analysis from August 2025 mentioned a potential breakout area around \"1540ish\" (presumably $15.40), but this is not a current call wall for the nearest expiration.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration. While the concept of gamma flip and its impact on APLD's volatility is discussed, a specific numerical \"gamma flip volatility pivot\" for the nearest expiration is not provided.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n\n*   **CIFR (Cipher Mining Inc.)**:\n    *   **Call Wall Upside Barrier**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n\n*   **WULF (TeraWulf Inc.)**:\n    *   **Call Wall Upside Barrier**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Put Wall Hard Floor**: Data unavailable for nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration.\n    *   **Max Pain Point**: The Max Pain for WULF options expiring on January 23, 2026, is $12.50. The Max Pain for January 16, 2026, was $10.00. Given January 21, 2026, as the current date, the nearest monthly expiration is January 23, 2026, with a Max Pain of $12.50."

      "Results": "The analysis of \"call wall upside barrier,\" \"gamma flip volatility pivot,\" \"put wall hard floor,\" and \"max pain point\" for specific stock tickers requires access to real-time options order book data, open interest, implied volatility surfaces, and specialized options analytics tools that are not available through standard web searches. These metrics are dynamic and change constantly with market activity.\n\nTherefore, I am unable to provide the precise, real-time numerical values for SPY, AAPL, NVDA, META, MSFT, AVGO, GOOG, and AMZN for the nearest monthly/LEAPS expiration as requested. Returning a '0' for unavailable data would be misleading as it would imply that the metric does not exist rather than not being retrievable by me through Google Search.\n\nHowever, I can provide a general understanding of these concepts:\n\n*   **Call Wall Upside Barrier:** This is typically identified by a significant concentration of open interest in call options at a particular strike price. It represents a level where market makers who are short these calls may hedge by selling the underlying stock, thus creating resistance to further price increases.\n*   **Gamma Flip Volatility Pivot:** The gamma flip point is the strike price at which the aggregate gamma of options changes from negative to positive, or vice-versa. It's a critical level where market makers' hedging activities switch from potentially amplifying price movements (negative gamma) to dampening them (positive gamma), influencing the stock's volatility profile.\n*   **Put Wall Hard Floor:** Similar to the call wall, the put wall is a strike price with a large amount of open interest in put options. Market makers who are short these puts might hedge by buying the underlying stock as the price approaches this level, thereby providing support and acting as a \"floor\" for the stock price.\n*   **Max Pain Point:** The max pain point is the strike price at which the greatest number of options (calls and puts combined) would expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for option buyers and maximum gain for option sellers (typically market makers). It is often seen as a magnet for the stock price as expiration approaches.\n\nTo obtain the specific values for these metrics, you would need to use specialized options analytics platforms or data providers that offer real-time options chain analysis and calculations based on current market data."
