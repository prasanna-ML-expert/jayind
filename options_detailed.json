A break below $75.00 (Max Pain) would trigger an accelerative \"Gamma Flush\" toward the $50.00 Put Wall.\n\nQBTS (D-Wave Quantum): Following the acquisition of Quantum Circuits and the Trump-Arctic deal, QBTS is seeing a \"Vanna-Positive\" drift.

Currently, the $2.85 Gamma Flip is the critical pivot. Trading below this level puts dealers in a \"Short Gamma\" regime, where they must sell into price drops to stay delta-neutral, potentially testing the $1.50 Put Wall floor.\n\nBE (Bloom Energy): Following its exponential performance, BE has moved into a high-nominal-price regime. The $152.35 Gamma Flip acts as the current \"volatility master switch.\" As long as price action remains pinned between the $135.00 Max Pain and the call wall, realized volatility will likely remain suppressed by dealer hedging.\n\nFCEL (FuelCell Energy): FCEL is exhibiting \"Long Gamma\" behavior above $9.15. The clustering of open interest near the $8.00 Max Pain point suggests that market makers are effectively \"shorting volatility,\" profiting from the theta decay of retail-heavy call positions.\n\nBLDP (Ballard Power): Ballard shows a tight structural corridor. The $3.10 Gamma Flip is the primary line in the sand. A move above this level would likely trigger a dealer-led \"vanna-squeeze\" back toward the $5.00 Call Wall as short-dated volatility contracts.\n\nHYLN / BW: Options liquidity is currently insufficient for structural forensic analysis (return 0).\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Delta-Negative\" accumulation in PLUG at the $2.00 strike for the February 20 expiration.

We are observing a significant \"Vanna-Positive\" drift in the SMR sub-sector (OKLO, SMR, NNE); as implied volatility (IV) begins to contract following the Meta/Vistra/Oklo partnership news, dealers are forced to buy back delta hedges, creating a mechanical \"floor\" despite spot price volatility.

The $94.50 Gamma Flip is the critical \"master switch\" for today's session. Trading below this level keeps market makers in a \"Short Gamma\" posture, requiring them to sell into weakness to stay delta-neutral. Support is structurally anchored at the $75.00 Put Wall.\n\nCCJ (Cameco): Exhibits the most disciplined institutional architecture. The $85.00 Call Wall represents a formidable structural ceiling. With the Gamma Flip at $72.40, the stock is in a \"Long Gamma\" regime above this level, meaning dealers will sell strength and buy dips, dampening volatility and likely forcing a pin near the $70.00 Max Pain for the February cycle.\n\nLEU (Centrus Energy): Following the $900M DOE award, LEU has established a high-nominal-price floor. The $350.00 Call Wall is the target for momentum traders, but market makers have built a \"hard floor\" at the $250.00 Put Wall to protect against a reversal of the domestic enrichment narrative.\n\nSMR (NuScale Power): SMR is seeing a tightening of dealer hedging. The $19.15 Gamma Flip is the line in the sand; a sustained break above this level would trigger a mechanical \"squeeze\" toward the $25.00 Call Wall as dealers rush to cover short-delta exposures.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking an unusual \"Call-Butterfly\" accumulation in UEC targeting the $20 strike for the March expiration.
