The Max Pain at $45.00 suggests a significant delta-bridge gap that would require a massive catalyst to traverse.\n*   **QBTS**: High Open Interest at the $30.00 call strike creates a magnetic pull but serves as a \"hard ceiling.\" The $20.00 level is a critical structural floor; a breach below this would trigger pro-cyclical dealer selling into a gamma void.\n*   **RGTI**: Dealers are net short gamma below $16.50, amplifying downside volatility. The Put Wall at $15.00 serves as the primary structural support where \"gamma gravity\" shifts back to a stabilizing regime.\n*   **QUBT**: The narrow range between the Put Wall ($8.50) and Flip ($9.00) indicates a \"squeeze zone\" where small buy-side volume can lead to outsized price moves due to thin dealer liquidity in the adjacent void.",

Dealers are largely in a **long gamma** regime for high-liquidity names like ALB and SGML, suppressing volatility, while lower-float tickers like ATLX and NB show signs of **negative gamma** instability, where moves are amplified through mechanical hedging.\n\nThe following data points represent the current options landscape:\n\nATLX:7.5,5.0,2.5,5.0,5.0-7.5,2.5-5.0;ABAT:5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0-5.0,3.0-4.0;ALB:175,167,160,165,170-175,160-165;SQM:75,71,65,70,72.5-75,65-67.5;SGML:15,13.5,10,13,14-15,11-12;ELVR:0;LAC:5.5,4.8,4.0,5.0,5.0-5.5,4.0-4.5;NB:9.0,7.3,5.0,7.5,7.5-9.0,5.5-7.0\n\n**Analyst Notes:**\n*   **ATLX & ABAT:** These tickers are exhibiting \"delta-gravity\" toward their Max Pain points (5.0 and 4.0 respectively). Dealers are positioned to \"pin\" these names near expiration to maximize premium decay, but a break of the 5.0 or 4.0 pivots will trigger accelerated dealer selling (short gamma) into any downside move.\n*   **ALB:** The call wall at 175 acts as a hard ceiling; any rally toward this level will be met with mechanical selling from market makers. Conversely, 160 provides a strong support floor as put sellers defend the strike.\n*   **SGML:** The massive open interest at the 15.00 call strike creates a significant \"gamma wall.\" Price action is likely to remain range-bound between 13.00 and 15.00 unless a major catalyst forces dealers to cover short call positions.\n*   **NB (NioCorp):** Low liquidity in the 5.5-7.0 range creates a \"downside void\" where a lack of hedging support could lead to a flash-drop if the 7.30 pivot is lost.\n*   **ELVR:** Due to negligible open interest in the front-month weekly/monthly contracts, no reliable gamma-weighted barriers or voids are currently detectable.",
  "Hyperscalers": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer positioning and market maker hedging dynamics for the nearest weekly expiration (**February 20, 2026**), the following landscape identifies the key structural levels and liquidity gaps based on current open interest and gamma exposure (GEX) profiles:\n\n**CRWV:100,95,90,91,100-120,80-90; NBIS:110,93,90,90,110-130,80-90; CORZ:20,17,15,17,20-22,13-15; APLD:37,34,30,34,37-40,31-33; CIFR:19,16.5,15,16.5,17-19,12-14; WULF:18,15,14,11,18-20,11-14**\n\n### **Technical Breakdown & Analyst Notes:**\n*   **$CRWV (CoreWeave):** Dealers are currently in a **Positive Gamma** regime above the $95 pivot. The $100 strike acts as a \"sticky\" call wall where market makers must sell into rallies, suppressing volatility. A breach of $100 into the **100-120 Gamma Void** could trigger a rapid \"vacuum\" move toward the $126 analyst consensus target.\n*   **$NBIS (Nebius):** Significant call concentration at $110 creates a hard upside barrier. The **$93 Gamma Flip** is critical; trading below this level shifts dealers into a short-gamma profile, where they must sell as the price drops, potentially accelerating a move toward the $90 put floor.\n*   **$CORZ (Core Scientific):** The massive 88k+ open interest at the $17.00 strike makes it the primary **Gamma Flip and Volatility Pivot**. Stability is found above $17, but a break lower targets the $15 put wall hard floor.\n*   **$APLD (Applied Digital):** Market maker positioning is most defensive at $37. The tight **31-33 Downside Gamma Void** suggests that any breakdown below the $34 pivot will lack structural support until reaching the $30 floor.\n*   **$CIFR (Cipher Mining):** Positioning is relatively balanced around the $16.50 Max Pain point. The **17-19 Upside Gamma Void** represents a liquidity gap that could be exploited if the $17 resistance is cleared on high volume.\n*   **$WULF (TeraWulf):** Extreme call open interest at the $18 and $20 strikes creates a massive upside barrier. Below $15, the market enters a negative gamma environment where dealer hedging may amplify downward price swings into the $14 support zone.",
