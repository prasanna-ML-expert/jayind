A \"gamma void\" exists between $10 and $12; a breach of the $10 call wall would likely trigger a rapid delta-hedging squeeze as MMs chase the upside.\n*   **$ON:** The stock is tightly compressed around the $69 pivot. With the gamma flip and Max Pain converged at this level, volatility is suppressed unless price slides into the negative gamma regime below $68.\n*   **$ALAB:** A significant concentration of put gamma at $129 acts as a hard floor. The $132 Max Pain point suggests a slight upward magnetic pull from the current spot price, though the $130 call wall serves as a formidable barrier.\n*   **$COHR:** This ticker exhibits a high \"Pain Trade\" setup, with the spot price significantly above the $217.50 Max Pain level. MMs are structurally short calls here, creating an explosive upside risk if the $260 barrier is decisively cleared.\n*   **$AOSL & $POWI:** Forensic data for the current weekly expiration is insufficient due to negligible open interest and liquidity at key strikes; thus, they are marked as 0.",

With the gamma flip at $55.00, current price action below this level keeps the regime in \"short gamma,\" meaning market makers are likely to sell into weakness, increasing realized volatility.\n*   **$RZLV**: Dealers are net long gamma above $2.50, which should dampen volatility near the $3.00 Max Pain. However, a breach of the $2.50 put wall could trigger a \"gamma slide\" into the downside void toward $2.00.\n*   **$AMBA**: The $70.00 pivot is the current center of gravity.

Market makers are forced to sell into rallies near the Call Wall and buy into dips near the Put Wall, creating \"sticky\" resistance and support.\n*   **Gamma Flip**: This is the volatility pivot. Above this level, dealers are net long gamma (dampening volatility); below it, they flip to net short gamma (amplifying volatility via reflexive selling/hedging).\n*   **Gamma Voids**: These strike ranges lack significant open interest or dealer hedging obligations. When price enters a \"void,\" the lack of dealer counter-flow often leads to rapid, \"slippery\" price moves as momentum and discretionary flows dominate.",
