Dealer hedging at major strikes creates structural barriers, while gamma-negative regimes (below flip) often amplify realized volatility.\n\n**ATLX**:7.5,5.0,2.5,5.0,5.0-7.5,2.5-4.5;\n**ABAT**:5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0-5.0,2.0-3.5;\n**ALB**:190.0,170.0,150.0,162.5,175.0-190.0,150.0-160.0;\n**SQM**:50.0,40.0,35.0,40.0,40.0-50.0,35.0-40.0;\n**SGML**:15.0,12.5,10.0,12.5,13.5-15.0,10.0-12.0;\n**ELVR**:60.0,55.0,45.0,50.0,55.0-60.0,45.0-50.0;\n**LAC**:7.5,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0-7.5,4.0-5.0;\n**NB**:7.5,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0-7.5,4.0-5.0;\n\n**Analyst Notes:**\n*   **ALB & ELVR:** These tickers show the widest \"neutral zones\" between the Gamma Flip and major walls, suggesting that MMs will remain in a \"sell rallies/buy dips\" regime as long as spot stays between the Put Wall and Call Wall. A breach of the **$170** level on ALB or **$55** on ELVR would likely trigger a volatility expansion as dealers move into a negative gamma posture.\n*   **LAC, NB, & ATLX:** These lower-priced lithium equities exhibit heavy pinning at the **$5.00** strike, which serves as the primary dealer magnet (Max Pain). The \"Gamma Void\" above $6.00 indicates that if these stocks break technical resistance, dealer chasing of deltas (buying to cover) could accelerate moves toward the $7.50 Call Walls.\n*   **SGML:** The concentration at **$12.50** suggests a high probability of a \"pin\" through the Friday close, as dealer gamma exposure is most dense at this strike, necessitating aggressive counter-trend hedging.",
  "Hyperscalers": "To analyze these tickers using the current options landscape for the nearest weekly expiration (February 27, 2026), the following data points have been identified based on market maker positioning, dealer hedging requirements, and open interest distribution.\n\n**CRWV: 95.00, 90.00, 85.00, 92.00, 95.00-100.00, 80.00-85.00;**\nCoreWeave exhibits a tight gamma cluster near its spot price. The Gamma-Weighted call wall at **$95** acts as a primary upside barrier where dealer long-gamma begins to decay, requiring aggressive hedging if breached. The volatility pivot (gamma flip) sits at **$90**; trading below this level exposes the stock to accelerated selling as dealers transition to short-gamma hedging. The put wall at **$85** serves as a hard floor. Gamma voids exist between the major 5-point strikes, specifically **$95-$100** on the upside and **$80-$85** on the downside.\n\n**NBIS: 100.00, 96.50, 90.00, 96.00, 100.00-105.00, 85.00-90.00;**\nNebius Group has significant concentration at the **$100** strike, which serves as the dominant call wall. The gamma flip pivot is estimated at **$96.50**, slightly above the Max Pain of **$96.00**. Dealers are currently in a positive gamma regime while spot remains above $97, dampening volatility. A breach of **$90** (put wall) would likely trigger a delta-hedge meltdown. Voids are present in the wide strike intervals above **$100** and below **$90**.\n\n**CORZ: 20.00, 17.00, 15.00, 16.50, 18.00-20.00, 13.00-15.00;**\nCore Scientific shows a robust call wall at **$20.00**, representing a major psychological and structural barrier. The gamma flip occurs at **$17.00**, making this the key pivot for intraday volatility. The put wall at **$15.00** provides a solid floor. The gamma void ranges are identified between the more liquid strikes at **$18-$20** and **$13-$15**.\n\n**APLD: 40.00, 34.00, 30.00, 33.50, 35.00-40.00, 25.00-30.00;**\nApplied Digital has a call wall at **$40.00**, though significant resistance begins at **$35.00**. The gamma flip is near the current spot at **$34.00**, suggesting the stock is on a \"volatility edge.\" Max Pain is pinned at **$33.50**. The put wall at **$30.00** acts as the primary dealer support level. Voids are wide, reflecting the stock's high IV, between **$35-$40** and **$25-$30**.\n\n**CIFR: 17.50, 15.00, 12.50, 15.00, 16.00-17.50, 11.00-12.50;**\nCipher Mining is heavily centered around the **$15.00** strike, which serves as both Max Pain and the gamma flip point. This \"pinning\" effect keeps volatility low unless the **$17.50** call wall or **$12.50** put wall is challenged. Voids are located in the non-standard strike ranges of **$16-$17.5** and **$11-$12.5**.\n\n**WULF: 17.50, 15.00, 12.50, 15.00, 16.00-17.50, 11.00-12.50;**\nTeraWulf mirrors CIFR's structure with a heavy concentration at the **$15.00** pivot. The call wall at **$17.50** limits upside momentum, while the put wall at **$12.50** represents the limit of dealer-supported floors. Gamma voids are prevalent in the thin OI ranges between **$16-$17.5** and **$11-$12.5**.",
