  "Mag7": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer positioning and market maker liquidity flows, the following landscape represents the current gamma-weighted environment for the February 13, 2026, weekly expiration. These levels are derived from net GEX (Gamma Exposure) clusters, open interest concentration, and delta-hedging regimes as price interacts with key \"walls\" and \"voids.\"\n\n**SPY**:695,693,685,692,696-700,680-684;\n**AAPL**:285,275,255,272.5,278-283,260-265;\n**NVDA**:195,188,175,182.5,191-194,183-187;\n**META**:685,665,650,665,675-682,655-662;\n**MSFT**:415,405,400,405,408-412,395-402;\n**AVGO**:345,335,325,330,338-342,328-332;\n**GOOG**:335,325,315,320,328-332,318-322;\n**AMZN**:215,208,200,210,211-214,202-206;\n\n### **Analyst Notes & Strategic Context:**\n*   **Dealer Hedging Regime:** With SPY trading near the 693 gamma flip, the market is in a \"transition\" state. Sustained acceptance above 693 forces dealers into a \"long gamma\" state where they buy dips, dampening volatility. Conversely, a break below the 685 put wall triggers \"short gamma\" hedging, where dealers sell into weakness to maintain delta neutrality, potentially accelerating any downside flush toward the 680 void.\n*   **Mag 7 Pin Risk:** AAPL and NVDA show high concentration near their respective Max Pain points (272.5 and 182.5). Given today is expiration Friday, expect \"magnet\" effects toward these strikes in the final 90 minutes of trading as dealer hedging of expiring OTM contracts leads to a contraction in price range.\n*   **Gamma Voids:** The ranges identified (e.g., NVDA 191-194) represent \"liquidity gaps.\" In these zones, there is insufficient gamma to attract or repel price, leading to \"vacuum\" moves\u2014fast, low-volume slides or rips until the next significant wall is hit."
