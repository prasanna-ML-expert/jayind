  "Mining": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer positioning and market maker (MM) hedging mechanics, the following is an analysis of the options landscape for the crypto-mining sector for the active February 27, 2026, weekly expiration.\n\nDealer positioning across the sector shows a prevailing \"pinning\" regime at major round numbers, with the notable exception of high-beta names like IREN and HUT, which are currently exhibiting \"thin\" liquidity zones (gamma voids) that allow for outsized volatility expansion following recent momentum.\n\n**MARA**:8.50,8.00,6.00,8.00,9.00-10.00,6.50-7.50;\n**CLSK**:11.50,10.00,8.50,10.00,11.00-12.00,9.00-9.50;\n**BITF**:2.50,2.00,2.00,2.00,3.00-3.50,1.00-1.50;\n**HIVE**:3.00,2.50,2.00,2.50,3.50-4.00,1.50-2.00;\n**BTBT**:2.50,1.75,1.50,2.00,3.00-3.50,1.00-1.25;\n**HUT**:60.00,55.00,51.00,53.00,62.00-66.00,42.00-46.00;\n**RIOT**:18.00,16.50,15.50,16.50,19.00-20.00,13.00-14.00;\n**IREN**:41.50,41.05,35.00,43.00,46.50-50.00,30.00-33.00;\n\n**Analytical Summary:**\n1.  **Gamma-Weighted Call Walls:** Acting as structural resistance, these levels represent the strikes where dealers are most long-gamma; a push through these levels typically requires significant buy-side order flow to overcome dealer selling as they de-hedge.\n2.  **Gamma Flip Pivots:** These \"zero gamma\" points represent the threshold where dealer hedging shifts from stabilizing (positive gamma) to destabilizing (negative gamma). Trading below these pivots typically results in amplified realized volatility.\n3.  **Put Wall Hard Floors:** Significant concentrations of put open interest provide a structural \"bid\" under the market as MMs buy back shares to maintain delta neutrality as the stock approaches these strikes.\n4.  **Gamma Voids:** These ranges represent \"air pockets\" in the options chain where open interest is sparse. If price enters these zones, it often results in rapid, non-linear moves due to the lack of dealer hedging friction.",
