A significant **Gamma Void** exists above $14.50, suggesting rapid \"gapping\" potential if $14.00 is breached.\n3.  **EVEX (Eve Holding):** Positioning is heavily concentrated at the $5.00 strike for both calls and puts.

The **Put Wall** at $2.50 is the only structural support below the current price. Because Call OI dwarfs Put OI (13,913 to 1,139), dealers are heavily long gamma above $5.00, which should dampen upside volatility but leave the downside \"hollow\" in the event of a $5.00 break.",

The **Gamma Void** ranges identified above represent \"slippery\" price zones with low liquidity concentration where the underlying can move rapidly due to a lack of institutional hedging resistance.\n*   **Safety Floors**: **CCJ** and **BWXT** exhibit the strongest dealer-supported floors at **$120** and **$200** respectively, where heavy put gamma serves as a structural buffer against further downside.",
