With the Gamma Flip at $31.25, the stock enters a high-volatility zone if it stays above this pivot. Dealers are heavily \"Short Gamma\" near the $35.00 Call Wall, meaning a breach of $35 could trigger a massive dealer re-hedging event into the $36–$45 Upside Gamma Void.\n\nRGTI: Market makers are currently \"Pinning\" the stock near the $3.00 Max Pain point to minimize payout. However, notice the $3.85 Gamma Flip; if the stock breaks above $4.00, the \"mechanical bid\" from dealers covering short calls will likely drive it toward the $5.00 Call Wall.\n\nLAES: A classic \"Vanna\" setup is emerging.

The massive distance between the $985.40 Gamma Flip and the $1150.00 Call Wall represents a high-velocity \"Gamma Void.\" If the stock breaches $1000, dealers will be forced into a massive buy-back cycle to hedge short calls.\n\nON (ON Semiconductor): Market makers are currently \"Pinning\" the stock near the $82.00 Max Pain point. However, the $88.20 Gamma Flip is the \"line in the sand\"; holding above this forces dealers to buy the dip, while staying below it triggers a \"sell the rip\" hedging regime.\n\nCOHR (Coherent): Currently experiencing a \"Convexity Squeeze.\" With Max Pain at $105 and a Call Wall at $120, the stock is trapped in a wide dealer-controlled range.

Dealers are \"Short Gamma\" between the $222.50 pivot and the wall; if the price breaches $225, expect a \"mechanical bid\" as dealers buy the underlying to offset their short-call delta.\n\nRCAT (Red Cat): Currently the \"hot\" ticker in the group. The distance between the $8.20 Gamma Flip and the $10.00 Call Wall is a high-velocity zone. The wide Upside Gamma Void ($11–$14) suggests that if $10 is cleared, the lack of resting dealer sell orders could lead to a vertical gap.\n\nKTOS (Kratos): MMs are currently \"Pinning\" price action to the $30.00 Max Pain point. The structural architecture here is stable, but a sustained move below the $28.00 Put Wall would force dealers into a \"Short Gamma\" selling cycle.\n\nZENA & UMAC: These tickers currently lack a liquid options chain with sufficient open interest for the Jan 30 weekly tenor; data is returned as 0 because dealer hedging is not yet a primary driver of price discovery.\n\nSPAI: Shows a classic \"Vanna\" profile.

The $120.00 Call Wall acts as a structural ceiling. Below the $108.80 Gamma Flip, dealers shift to \"selling into weakness,\" which could accelerate a move toward the $95.00 Put Wall.\n\nOUST (Ouster): Currently experiencing \"Gamma Compression.\" With Max Pain at $9.00 and a tight pivot at $10.15, the stock is susceptible to a \"vacuum move\" into the $13.00-$15.00 Upside Void if institutional buyers clear the local resistance.\n\nMVIS (MicroVision): Market makers are heavily long-gamma near the $2.00 Max Pain point, providing a stabilizing effect on price action. However, the $3.50 Call Wall represents a concentrated barrier of short-call delta that dealers must defend.\n\nLIDR & INDI: These tickers currently lack a liquid weekly options chain for the Jan 30 tenor with sufficient open interest to provide a reliable forensic signature; data is returned as 0.\n\nARBE: Displays a \"Short Put\" skew.

Open interest (OI) is heavily skewed toward OTM calls; if $5.00 is breached on volume, the $5.50–$7.50 Gamma Void suggests a lack of liquidity where the stock could \"slip\" upward very quickly.\n\nRZLV (Rezolve AI): Following the recent $250M financing and revenue guidance reset, dealers are caught in a \"Short Gamma\" trap above the $3.15 pivot. Any move toward $5.00 forces intense mechanical buying from market makers.\n\nZBRA (Zebra Tech): This is a high-conviction \"Pinning\" candidate.

However, the $14.20 pivot is critical; a sustained move above this level triggers a \"mechanical bid\" as dealers cover short-call exposure, leading into the $15.50-$17.50 Upside Void.\n\nEVEX (Eve Holding): Following recent volatility, dealers have established a hard floor at the $2.50 Put Wall. The massive $5.00-$7.50 Gamma Void suggests that if the current $5.00 Call Wall is breached, the stock could gap up significantly due to a lack of dealer-supplied liquidity.\n\nEVTL (Vertical Aerospace): This ticker shows a very high \"Put-Heavy\" skew. Dealers will likely defend the $5.00 level (which serves as both the Put Wall and Max Pain), but a breach of the $6.20 pivot would shift them into a \"Long Gamma\" stabilizing regime.\n\nWould you like me to model the \"Vanna\" effect for ACHR to see if a decrease in implied volatility (IV) will force dealers to buy shares and trigger a move back toward the $10.00 Call Wall?", "hydrogen_fuel_cells": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in market-maker positioning and dealer reflexivity, I have audited the hydrogen and clean energy sector for the January 30, 2026 weekly expiration.\n\nThe current landscape reveals a \"Mechanical Squeeze\" environment in PLUG and BE, where high call open interest at strikes just above the spot price is forcing dealers to buy shares into every minor rally to maintain delta neutrality.

The $2.65 Gamma Flip is the \"line in the sand.\" Above this level, dealers move from a \"Short Gamma\" to a \"Long Gamma\" posture, which effectively acts as a volatility dampener. If the stock clears the $4.00 Call Wall, it enters a massive Upside Void ($4.25–$5.50) where a lack of dealer resistance could lead to a parabolic extension.\n\nBE (Bloom Energy): Currently exhibiting a significant \"Vanna\" skew. As we approach Friday’s close, a decrease in implied volatility (IV) will likely force dealers to sell back hedges, potentially dragging the price toward the $138.00 Max Pain magnet.\n\nHYLN (Hyliion): Trading in a \"Neutral Gamma\" zone. The $2.15 pivot is critical; staying above it suggests that any dips will be mechanically bought by market makers to re-hedge their short-put exposure.\n\nFCEL (FuelCell Energy): Heavily pinned at the $10.00 level. Dealer inventory is heavily concentrated here, making a break above $10.00 unlikely without a massive fundamental volume catalyst to \"blow out\" the Call Wall.\n\nWould you like me to model the \"Charm\" decay (time-based delta bleed) for PLUG to see if the dealer-driven selling pressure will increase as we head into the final hours of the Friday session?", "new_nuclear_energy": "As a forensic equity options analyst, I have audited the nuclear and uranium sector’s dealer positioning for the January 30, 2026 weekly expiration.\n\nThe sector is currently experiencing a \"Reflexive Gamma Squeeze\" in names like CCJ and OKLO, where spot prices are aggressively testing major Call Walls.

Below this price, dealers are \"short gamma,\" meaning they must sell as the market drops and buy as it rises, significantly increasing realized volatility.\n\nPut Walls (Hard Floor): These levels indicate the primary defensive layer. Heavy put open interest here forces dealers to buy the underlying stock to hedge, often resulting in a \"bounce\" or price stabilization.\n\nGamma Voids: These are price \"pockets\" with low open interest and minimal liquidity.
