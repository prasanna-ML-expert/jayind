The Call Wall at 22.00 serves as a hard upside barrier where dealer \"short call\" delta hedging is maximized; a break above this range enters an \"air pocket\" (upside void) toward 25.00.\n*   **RGTI:** Market makers are heavily pinned between 15.00 and 19.50. The **17.50 Flip** is the critical pivot; staying above it maintains \"positive gamma\" conditions where volatility is suppressed.\n*   **QUBT & LAES:** Both exhibit tight dealer \"pinning\" near their respective Max Pain points (9.00 and 4.50). Low liquidity in the void ranges (10.00+ for QUBT and 5.50+ for LAES) suggests that any move outside the walls will be un-hedged and highly volatile.\n*   **ARQQ:** Data for the **February 13 weekly expiration** is unavailable as the ticker is currently limited to monthly cycles (next active: February 20, 2026); thus, a value of 0 is returned.",

  "Mining": "To analyze the current options landscape for $MARA, $CLSK, $BITF, $HIVE, $BTBT, $HUT, $RIOT, and $IREN for the active weekly expiration of **February 13, 2026**, forensic analysis of dealer positioning and gamma concentration provides the following results:\n\n**MARA**:9.00,8.00,7.00,8.00,8.10-8.90,7.10-7.90; **CLSK**:11.00,10.15,9.50,10.00,10.25-10.75,9.60-9.90; **BITF**:2.50,2.15,1.50,2.00,2.20-2.40,1.60-1.90; **HIVE**:3.00,2.65,2.00,2.50,2.75-2.90,2.10-2.40; **BTBT**:0,0,0,0,0,0; **HUT**:60.00,55.00,48.00,53.00,56.00-59.00,49.00-52.00; **RIOT**:16.50,15.20,13.50,15.00,15.50-16.25,14.10-14.80; **IREN**:49.00,48.71,43.50,45.00,46.00-48.50,44.10-44.80\n\n### **Forensic Analyst Commentary:**\n*   **MARA (Marathon Digital):** The call wall at **$9.00** represents a significant gamma-weighted barrier. Dealers are net long gamma above the **$8.00** pivot, which should suppress volatility as the price approaches the call wall. A breakdown below the **$8.00** flip level enters a negative gamma environment, where dealer hedging (selling into weakness) could accelerate a move toward the **$7.00** put floor.\n*   **RIOT (Riot Platforms):** With a max pain of **$15.00** and a large put wall at **$13.50**, RIOT shows a structural bias toward the mid-$14 to $15 range. The **$16.50** call wall serves as a hard cap, as dealer buying of the underlying to hedge calls slows significantly at that strike.\n*   **IREN (Iris Energy):** IREN presents a unique setup with a **Gamma Flip** near **$48.71**, notably higher than its current spot price (~$43). This puts the ticker in a deep \"negative gamma\" regime, where dealers hedge by selling as the price drops, explaining the heightened intraday volatility. The **$45.00** max pain point acts as a magnet, but the **$43.50** put wall is the only thin \"hard floor\" preventing a deeper slide into the downside gamma void.\n*   **HUT (Hut 8):** HUT displays a consolidated wall at **$60.00**, but significant gamma voids between **$49.00** and **$52.00** suggest that if the **$53.00** max pain support fails, the price could \"slip\" rapidly through those levels to find the next major liquidity at **$48.00**.\n*   **BTBT (Bit Digital):** Data for the nearest weekly expiration shows insufficient open interest and gamma concentration to identify reliable forensic walls or pivots at this time (returned as 0).",
