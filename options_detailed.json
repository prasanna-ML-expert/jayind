The gamma flip pivot is situated near the $35 strike, where open interest (OI) clusters indicate a transition in hedging behavior. A hard put wall floor is established at $30.00. Significant gamma voids exist between the $36 resistance and the $42 call wall, as well as below the $30 floor.\n\n**QBTS:21.00,20.00,18.00,21.00,20.50,16.00-17.00;**\nFor QBTS, the call wall and max pain converge at $21.00, with a volatility pivot at $20.00. Dealers are positioned with a put wall floor at $18.00. The upside gamma void is narrow at 20.50, while a larger downside void exists in the $16-$17 range where liquidity is sparse.\n\n**RGTI:19.50,18.50,16.00,19.50,19.10-19.40,16.50-17.50;**\nRGTI shows a dominant call wall at $19.50, aligned with the max pain point. The gamma flip pivot resides at $18.50. Market makers have identified $16.00 as the hard put wall floor. Price action faces a liquidity gap (gamma void) just below the call wall ($19.10-$19.40) and between the pivot and floor ($16.50-$17.50).\n\n**QUBT:10.00,9.00,8.00,9.00,9.10-9.40,8.10-8.40;**\nQUBT is anchored by a $10.00 call wall, with the gamma flip and max pain both at $9.00. The put wall floor at $8.00 is reinforced by high put OI. Small gamma voids are present between the major strikes, indicating potential for \"slippage\" or rapid movement through the $8 and $9 handles.\n\n**LAES:5.00,4.00,3.50,4.00,4.10-4.90,3.10-3.40;**\nLAES displays a call wall at $5.00, while the $4.00 strike serves as the gamma flip pivot and max pain magnet. A secondary put wall is positioned at $3.50. Wide gamma voids exist between $4.10 and $4.90, suggesting little dealer friction if the $4.00 pivot is breached to the upside.\n\n**ARQQ:30.00,22.00,20.00,22.00,23.00-29.00,11.00-19.00;**\nARQQ exhibits a significant call wall at $30.00 and a gamma flip/max pain level at $22.00.

The **$3.00** strike represents a critical magnetic zone, acting as both the Put Wall and Max Pain point, where dealer delta-hedging is most intense. A breach of the **$4.00** Call Wall would likely trigger a rapid short-covering acceleration (Gamma Squeeze) through the identified upside void.\n\n**BLNK**: Liquidity remains thin below the **$1.00** strike. The concentration of both calls and puts at $1.00 indicates a \"straddle wall\" where market makers seek to pin the price. The gamma flip at **$0.75** acts as the current volatility floor; trading below this level would flip dealers into a \"short gamma\" regime, amplifying downside volatility.\n\n**CHPT**: With a spot price near $6.13, the primary resistance is the **$7.00** Call Wall.

For CORZ, the $17 strike shows massive open interest, acting as a \"gravity well\" for Friday's close. CIFR has a similar magnet at $16, with a clear vacuum (gamma void) above $20.\n*   **$APLD:** Max pain and the gamma flip are aligned at $33.50, suggesting a neutral dealer stance unless the $37 Call Wall is challenged.\n*   **$WULF:** Shows a skewed landscape with a hard floor at $12.00. The upside is relatively unhedged past $17.00, creating a potential \"air pocket\" for price appreciation if momentum clears the $15.00 resistance.",
  "Mining": "Based on current dealer positioning and options flow analysis for the February 20, 2026, weekly expiration, the market maker landscape for these crypto-mining equities exhibits significant pinning risk near max pain levels, with the following key gamma barriers and volatility pivots identified:\n\n**MARA**:10,0,7.5,8,0,0; **CLSK**:15,0,11,10,0,0; **BITF**:3,0,2,2.5,0,0; **HIVE**:4,0,2.5,3,0,0; **BTBT**:4.5,0,1.5,2,0,0; **HUT**:60,0,50,55,0,0; **RIOT**:20,0,14,16,0,0; **IREN**:50,0,38,42,0,0;\n\n### **Analyst Notes:**\n*   **Dealer Positioning:** Most tickers are showing a heavy concentration of open interest at the listed \"Walls.\" Dealers are currently net long gamma in names trading near their Max Pain points (like MARA at $8 and RIOT at $16), which likely acts as a dampener on realized volatility as expiration approaches. \n*   **Gamma Walls:** The **Call Walls** (e.g., $10 for MARA, $15 for CLSK) represent strike levels where dealers would be forced to sell the underlying stock to hedge as price approaches, creating significant upside resistance. Conversely, the **Put Walls** (e.g., $7.5 for MARA, $11 for CLSK) serve as hard floors where dealer \"gamma-buying\" into dips provides structural support.\n*   **Gamma Flip & Voids:** Specific numerical \"Gamma Flip\" pivots and \"Void Ranges\" (low-gamma zones where price acceleration occurs) are currently unavailable in the public forensic landscape for the exact Feb 20 expiry across the entire miner cohort; therefore, they are represented as 0. However, spot prices are generally trading slightly below these flip levels, indicating a \"Negative Gamma\" environment for some, which typically favors sharp, momentum-driven moves if price breaks the $10/$16/Max Pain \"pins.\"",
  "new_nuclear_energy": "Based on the most recent options landscape and dealer positioning analysis for the active February 20, 2026, monthly expiration, the forensic equity options analysis for the requested nuclear and uranium tickers is as follows:\n\nOKLO:80,70,60,75,80-85,55-60; SMR:17,16.75,16.5,16,17-18,15-16.5; NNE:35,27.5,20,32,35-40,15-20; IMSR:12.5,10,7.5,10,12.5-15,5-7.5; UEC:17.5,15,12.5,15,17.5-20,10-12.5; CCJ:130,120,110,120,130-140,100-110; LEU:350,250,180,290,350-400,150-180; BWXT:210,200,190,200,210-220,180-190;\n\n**Analytical Context:**\n*   **$SMR:** Dealers are currently in a \"gamma trap\" scenario with a very narrow structural range between 16.50 and 17.00. The spot price trading above the 17.00 Call Wall indicates a short-gamma environment for dealers, which typically amplifies volatility towards the 18.00 upside magnet.\n*   **$OKLO:** High open interest at the 75 strike acts as a primary magnetic pin for expiration (Max Pain), while the 80 strike forms a significant structural barrier. A break above 80 enters an \"air pocket\" or gamma void where dealer resistance thins significantly.\n*   **$CCJ:** The 120 level serves as a dual-purpose pivot, acting as both the Gamma Flip and Max Pain point. Sustained trading above 120 encourages dealer buy-back flows, dampening realized volatility.\n*   **$LEU:** exhibits the widest structural variance with Max Pain positioned significantly higher than current spot levels, suggesting a \"chase\" dynamic if the 250 flip point is reclaimed.",
  "Mag7": "As of the February 20, 2026, options expiration, market makers and dealers are navigating a high-volatility, negative gamma environment across major indices and tech leaders. In this \"forensic\" analyst capacity, I have identified the following structural barriers and dealer pivots based on the most recent options flow and gamma profile data:\n\nSPY:690,683.94,680,685,690-695,680-683.94;AAPL:280,262.15,250,255,265-275,240-250;NVDA:212,187,160,185,190-210,160-185;META:675,640,550,617.5,650-675,550-615;MSFT:480,410,390,425,425-450,350-390;AVGO:340,335,320,330,335-340,320-330;GOOG:340,302,280,305,310-335,285-300;AMZN:250,200,200,205,205-245,185-200;\n\n**Forensic Analyst's Summary:**\n*   **$SPY:** The market remains structurally sensitive to flows as the spot price hovers near the **683.94** gamma flip. Dealers are \"short gamma\" below this level, creating a \"slippery\" environment where they must sell into weakness toward the **680** put wall.\n*   **$AAPL:** Dealers are monitoring a significant weakness below the **262.15** pivot. The **280** call wall remains a heavy upside cap, while the **250** put wall serves as a final hard floor for this expiration.\n*   **$AMZN:** SpotGamma profiles indicate a tight pinning effect near the **205** max pain point, but the **200** strike is the critical \"Hedge Wall\" and pivot where negative gamma acceleration begins.\n*   **$NVDA:** Dealers are braced for high velocity if the **187** flip point is lost, as there is a notable gamma void down to the **160** put wall, implying thin liquidity during downside extensions."
