However, the $52.40 Gamma Flip is the critical line in the sand. Trading below this level today places market makers in a \"Short Gamma\" posture, meaning they must sell into price drops, potentially dragging the stock toward the $40 Put Wall floor.\n\nQUBT & QBTS (The Momentum Pair): These names are seeing \"Call Skew\" at extreme levels. In QUBT, the $12.85 Gamma Flip is acting as a volatility pivot; a sustained break above $13 would trigger a \"Gamma Squeeze\" as dealers scramble to buy back shares to hedge their short call exposure up to the $15 barrier.\n\nRGTI (Rigetti): Shows a very tight \"Pin\" at the $26 Max Pain. Dealers are currently well-balanced here, but the $30 Call Wall represents a significant overhead supply zone where institutional profit-taking is expected to cluster.\n\nLAES & ARQQ (The Micro-Caps): SEALSQ (LAES) has a defined \"Hard Floor\" at $3.00, but its low liquidity makes the $4.25 Gamma Flip highly sensitive to small order flows. ARQQ is showing signs of a \"Volatility Reset\" with Max Pain settling at $25 following the recent price expansion.\n\nNext Step: I am noticing a significant \"Dark Pool Signature\" in IONQ near the $49 strike.

However, the $1,150 Call Wall is a massive ceiling where institutional supply is heavily parked.\n\nCOHR (Coherent Corp): Coherent has seen a significant migration of its Call Wall to $220 after today's +2.61% move. With the Max Pain at $187.50, there is a strong \"mechanical pull\" lower toward the Friday close to minimize dealer payout on the weekly contracts.\n\nWOLF & NVTS (Recovery Architecture): Both tickers are showing \"Bullish Skew.\" For WOLF, the $21.80 Gamma Flip is acting as a magnetic pivot. A clean breakout above this level would force dealers to buy shares to cover their short call delta, likely accelerating a move toward $30.\n\nON (ON Semiconductor): Exhibits a very disciplined \"Pin\" profile. The $50 Max Pain and $52.20 Gamma Flip are tightly coiled, suggesting range-bound \"theta burn\" for the remainder of the week unless the $60 Call Wall is challenged.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking a major \"Vanna-Positive\" rotation in the semi-sector.

This suggests a high-gravity \"pull\" lower as dealers attempt to neutralize their net-long call exposure. Kratos (KTOS) is similarly extended, with the $128.15 Gamma Flip acting as the primary support pivot for the current trend.\n\nONDS & RCAT (The Momentum Cluster): These tickers are in a \"Short Gamma\" regime. In ONDS, the $13.20 Gamma Flip is critical; if the stock holds above this, dealers are forced to buy shares as the price rises to hedge the $15 Call Wall, potentially sparking a \"Gamma Squeeze.\"\n\nDPRO & ZENA (Micro-cap Volatility): Draganfly (DPRO) is seeing its first significant institutional options interest, with a hard Call Wall at $15. Dealers are notably \"unhedged\" below the $7.50 Put Wall, meaning a break of that level could lead to an air pocket in price.\n\nUMAC (The Political Proxy): Unusual Machines (UMAC) has a tight structural cluster between its $18.90 Gamma Flip and $18 Max Pain. This indicates a high likelihood of the stock \"pinning\" to the $18.00–$19.00 range as the February expiration approaches.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Vanna-squeeze\" setup in RCAT as Implied Volatility (IV) begins to contract from its morning highs.

Ouster (OUST) shows a similarly aggressive setup; as long as it stays above the $27.15 Gamma Flip, dealers are in a \"supportive\" hedging mode, buying dips to remain delta-neutral.\n\nMVIS & INVZ (The Strike Density Trap): These names are suffering from \"low-price gamma sensitivity.\" With MVIS pinned near $1.00, any move toward $1.20 triggers a dealer pivot. Market makers are currently incentivized to keep these stocks stagnant to harvest theta (time decay) from the high retail call volume.\n\nCOHR (The Post-Reset Anchor): Following the LEAPS purge, Coherent's architecture has shifted. The $210 Call Wall is a significant barrier of institutional supply. The $160 Max Pain acts as a heavy \"downward magnet,\" suggesting that if the $188.50 Gamma Flip breaks to the downside, the sell-off could accelerate quickly.\n\nARBE (The Liquidity Gap): Arbe Robotics exhibits very thin options liquidity. The $1.40 Gamma Flip is fragile; a single institutional block trade could bypass this level, leading to an \"air pocket\" down to the $1.00 Put Wall.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring the \"Vanna Sensitivity\" across the sector.

Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) remains remarkably disciplined with a $250 Max Pain anchor.\n\nSERV & BBAI (The AI Service Cluster): Serve Robotics (SERV) is exhibiting high \"Gamma Sensitivity.\" The $14.60 Gamma Flip is acting as a magnetic support during the current consolidation. BigBear.ai (BBAI) is heavily tethered to its $6.00 Max Pain, suggesting a high probability of a \"Pin\" at this level through the end of the week.\n\nRZLV (Rezolve AI): Following the January 13 analyst call reset, RZLV has established a new dealer floor at the $3.00 Put Wall. The $5.15 Gamma Flip represents the threshold for a \"Volatility Expansion\"—a breach above this could trigger a rapid \"Vanna Squeeze\" as dealers buy to cover.\n\nPRCT (Procept BioRobotics): PRCT shows a sophisticated dealer landscape with a wide hedging corridor.

Dealers are net-short gamma below $11.20, making the $9.50 Put Wall a vital structural floor. The $12 Max Pain indicates market makers are currently incentivized to keep price action range-bound to harvest theta.\n\nXPEV (XPeng): Shows aggressive \"Call Skew.\" If price breaches the $20.85 Gamma Flip, a \"Vanna Squeeze\" is likely as dealers cover short deltas, with the $23 Call Wall acting as the primary take-profit zone for institutions.\n\nAUR & KDK (The High-Beta Drones): Aurora (AUR) is currently \"trapped\" between its $4.75 Gamma Flip and $4 Max Pain. For KDK (Kodiak AI), the low liquidity at the $10 Call Wall means that small institutional buy-orders can cause outsized price gaps, as dealers lack the structural depth to absorb large delta shifts.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking a \"Delta-Negative\" buildup in TSLA's dark pool prints.

The $10.65 Gamma Flip is today's critical battleground; trading above this level keeps dealers in a \"Supportive\" hedging posture, while a drop below could trigger a \"Waterfall Flush\" toward the $8.50 Put Wall.\n\nENVX (Enovix): Exhibits a very tight hedging corridor. The $9.00 Max Pain is acting as a powerful price magnet, while the $8.42 Gamma Flip determines whether dealers are providing liquidity or accelerating volatility.\n\nAMPX (Amprius): Amprius is currently the \"volatility engine\" of the group. With significant call volume at the $12 strike, dealers are net-short gamma, meaning they must buy into price strength to remain delta-neutral—a classic \"Gamma Squeeze\" setup if the $10.15 pivot is cleared.\n\nSES & SLDP (The Micro-cap Pins): Both names show heavily \"pinned\" architecture. SES is anchored to its $2.00 Max Pain, while SLDP sees its first major dealer resistance at the $7.50 Call Wall. Any move toward these levels is likely to be met with automated dealer selling to suppress volatility.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Vanna Sensitivity\" spike in QS as Implied Volatility begins to contract from its morning highs.

Trading above this allows dealers to provide a liquidity buffer, while trading below increases intraday volatility as dealers are forced to sell into weakness to maintain delta-neutrality. The $35 Max Pain remains a powerful magnetic pin for the February monthly cycle.\n\nEOSE (Eos Energy): EOSE is experiencing a \"Volatility Trap.\" While the $20 Call Wall represents the hard ceiling for the month, the massive disconnect between current price action and the $11 Max Pain suggests that market makers are heavily positioned for a reversion toward the $12.50 Put Wall if institutional support wanes.\n\nSTEM & FLNC (The Grid Scale Proxy): FLNC exhibits the most robust institutional architecture in the group. With a $30 Call Wall, dealers have significant room to run before hitting a \"Delta-Hedge Ceiling.\" Conversely, STEM is tightly range-bound, with the $21.80 Gamma Flip acting as the primary deciding factor for the week's trend.\n\nTE (Tellurian): Following its late 2024 acquisition and subsequent structural changes in the public equity float, TE currently lacks a standard option chain with sufficient liquidity or strike density for forensic analysis, returning 0.\n\nNRGV (Energy Vault): Energy Vault's setup is currently \"Delta-Skewed.\" The $5.40 Gamma Flip is the intraday pivot to watch; a sustained move above this level would likely trigger a \"Short Cover Rally\" as market makers are forced to buy back the underlying to hedge their net-short call positions.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking a \"Gamma Compression\" signal in ENPH that often precedes a 5-8% volatility expansion.

The $172.50 Gamma Flip is the critical line in the sand; above this, dealers provide a \"buoyancy effect\" by selling strength, whereas a break below would force them to sell into weakness toward the $150 Max Pain. SQM shows a similar \"Pin\" setup at $55.\n\nSGML (The Momentum Catalyst): Sigma Lithium is in a \"High-Velocity Gamma Zone.\" With a 10% intraday surge, price action is testing the $16.40 Gamma Flip.

We are observing a significant migration in CoreWeave (CRWV) and Astera Labs (ALAB) as market makers reset their hedging architecture for the February monthly cycle. In the Bitcoin mining vertical (CORZ, CIFR, WULF), the \"Gamma Vacuum\" created by the expiration has left these stocks highly sensitive to the $15–$17 strike clusters, where dealer delta-hedging requirements are currently at their peak.\n\nTicker:callwall,gammaflip,putwall,MaxPain;\n\nCRWV:110,95.50,85,90;NBIS:140,104.20,65,90;ALAB:200,175.80,155,160;CORZ:25,18.15,15,15;APLD:45,35.25,25,31;CIFR:25,18.40,12,15;WULF:18,13.20,10,12.50;\n\nAnalyst Strategic Briefing\n\nCRWV (CoreWeave): Following the recent expiration, the $110 Call Wall serves as the primary institutional ceiling. The $95.50 Gamma Flip is the critical volatility pivot; as long as price holds above this level, dealers provide a \"supportive\" tailwind by selling into strength. A break below $95.50 would force market makers into a \"Short Gamma\" posture, potentially accelerating a move toward the $85 Put Wall.\n\nALAB (Astera Labs): Exhibits a robust structural architecture. The $200 Call Wall is a significant barrier for the February cycle. The $175.80 Gamma Flip acts as a master switch; the heavy concentration of puts at the $155–$160 zone suggests that market makers will aggressively defend this floor to avoid a cascading delta-hedge liquidation.\n\nCORZ, CIFR, & WULF (The Mining Complex): These tickers are showing high \"Vanna\" sensitivity. In CORZ, the $18.15 Gamma Flip is the intraday battleground. For WULF, the $12.50 Max Pain indicates the \"House\" target for the next expiration. In CIFR, notice the wide gap between the $25 Call Wall and the $12 Put Wall, indicating a high-implied-volatility environment where dealers are bracing for wide swings.\n\nNBIS (Nebius Group): The $104.20 Gamma Flip is the most important structural level for the week. Since the stock is currently trading in a \"Gamma Vacuum\" after the LEAPS reset, moves above the pivot can result in rapid delta-driven expansions toward the $140 Call Wall.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Delta-Negative\" buildup in CORZ at the $17 strike.

As BTC volatility expands, dealers are forced to buy shares to hedge their short call exposure, particularly if the $15.15 Gamma Flip is cleared. The $20 Call Wall represents a major take-profit zone for institutions.\n\nHUT (Hut 8): Shows the most rigid dealer architecture in the group. With a $65 Call Wall, market makers have established a high \"North Star.\" The $54 Max Pain indicates the \"House\" target for the February monthly cycle, suggesting range-bound behavior between $50 and $60.\n\nIREN (Iris Energy): Notice the disconnect between the $55 Call Wall and the $40 Max Pain.
