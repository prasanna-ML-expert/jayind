  "quantum": "To provide a forensic analysis of these quantum computing and related technology stocks, we look at the dealer positioning for the nearest weekly expiration (**February 27, 2025**). Dealers and market makers are currently navigating a high-volatility environment in the quantum sector, where thin open interest (OI) outside of major strikes creates \"gamma voids\"\u2014ranges where price movement can accelerate due to a lack of hedging friction.\n\n### **Forensic Options Analysis Summary**\n\n*   **$IONQ:** Dealers are heavily pinned near the $30\u2013$32 range. A significant Call Wall at $36 acts as the primary upside barrier. The \"gamma flip\" at $32 is the pivot; below this, dealer hedging shifts from stabilizing (buying dips) to accelerating (selling into weakness), making the $30 Put Wall a \"hard floor\" that dealers will defend to avoid a cascading delta sell-off.\n*   **$QBTS:** Trading near its Max Pain of $19, the stock is in a \"sticky\" regime. The Call Wall at $21 represents a significant supply zone. A breakdown below $19 triggers short-gamma acceleration toward the $17.50\u2013$18.00 support.\n*   **$RGTI:** Displays a very aggressive Call Wall at $18 (highest OI concentration). The $17 level is the current volatility trigger. If the stock fails to hold $17, it enters a \"slippery\" downside void until it hits the $14 Put Wall.\n*   **$QUBT:** Shows a tight pinning at $8.50. The Call Wall at $10 is the ultimate ceiling, with a wide gamma void above $10 that could lead to a \"squeeze\" if broken.\n*   **$LAES:** Extremely high Max Pain ($6.00) relative to current spot (~$3.92) suggests dealers are heavily net short out-of-the-money (OTM) calls, incentivizing them to move price toward the $4.50 Call Wall.\n*   **$ARQQ:** Currently lacks a standard weekly expiration for Feb 27, 2025; all current liquidity resides in the March monthly cycle.\n\n**Ticker:callwall,gammaflip,putwall,MaxPain,upside gammavoid range,downside gammavoid range**\n\nIONQ:36,32,30,35,33.5-35.5,28.0-29.5;QBTS:21,19,18,19,19.5-20.5,16.0-17.5;RGTI:18,17,14,17.5,18.5-19.5,14.5-15.5;QUBT:10,8.5,8,8.5,10.5-11.5,4.0-6.0;LAES:4.5,4,3.5,6,5.5-6.5,2.0-3.0;ARQQ:0",

Dealers are net long gamma at the $1.00 strike for MVIS, which will suppress volatility unless the spot price moves into the downside void below $0.85.\n*   **OUST**: Shows a more sophisticated structure with a $19.00 Max Pain point acting as a magnet. The $18.75 gamma flip is the key pivot; trading below this level forces dealers into \"short gamma\" hedging, which would accelerate any move toward the $17.00 put wall.\n*   **LIDR**: Options liquidity is extremely thin; the identified levels represent the only significant clusters of dealer hedging responsibility. The wide gap between the $1.00 floor and $2.50 ceiling creates a massive \"volatility vacuum\" where price action is driven almost entirely by equity flow rather than options hedging.",

For $HUT, the range above $70 is thin, suggesting a potential squeeze if the $65 barrier is breached.",
  "new_nuclear_energy": "As a forensic equity options analyst examining market maker hedging dynamics for the February 27, 2026, weekly expiration, the current options landscape reflects a high-volatility regime with significant gamma concentration at psychological and technical breakout levels. Dealers are currently positioning to manage delta exposure against aggressive call buying in the \"SMR\" subsector, with notable \"pinning\" risks at Max Pain points.\n\nThe following levels identify the structural boundaries of the current tape:\n\n**OKLO**: 100, 86, 57, 70, 105-125, 35-50;\n**SMR**: 21, 15, 13, 14.5, 17-20, 11-12;\n**NNE**: 28, 26.5, 24, 28, 30-35, 20-22;\n**IMSR**: 10, 8, 5, 10, 8.5-9.5, 3-4;\n**UEC**: 18, 16.12, 14, 16.5, 18.5-19.3, 14.5-15.5;\n**CCJ**: 120, 118, 113, 118, 125-130, 105-110;\n**LEU**: 250, 230, 205, 230, 235-245, 210-220;\n**BWXT**: 220, 210, 200, 205, 225-240, 180-195;\n\n**Analyst Notes:**\n*   **OKLO** and **NNE** exhibit \"Negative Gamma\" conditions below their flip pivots, suggesting that any breach of the Put Wall floor could trigger accelerated dealer selling to maintain delta neutrality.\n*   **CCJ** and **BWXT** show the most stable \"Positive Gamma\" shielding, with market makers likely providing liquidity and dampening volatility as long as spot price remains above the $118 and $210 pivots respectively.\n*   **IMSR** (Terrestrial Energy) maintains a low-liquidity profile; the $10 Call Wall represents a significant \"hard ceiling\" where dealer short-call hedging could create heavy overhead resistance.",
  "Mag7": "Based on the most recent forensic analysis of dealer positioning and options microstructure for the nearest weekly expiration (February 27, 2026), the landscape for the requested tickers is as follows:\n\n**SPY**:685,686,680,683,686-688,682-685;\n**AAPL**:280,275,270,260,275-280,265-270;\n**NVDA**:200,182.40,180,187.50,185-195,175-180;\n**META**:650,640,625,650,645-650,630-640;\n**MSFT**:410,395,385,400,400-405,390-395;\n**AVGO**:340,332.50,330,330,335-340,320-330;\n**GOOG**:320,316,310,315,315-320,305-310;\n**AMZN**:210,205,200,205,205-210,195-205\n\n**Analyst Notes:**\n*   **Dealer Hedging Dynamics:** $SPY is currently in a high positive gamma regime with dealers actively pinning price action between the 683 Max Pain and 686 Gamma Flip. A break of the 686 pivot would trigger volatility expansion as dealers shift to short gamma hedging.\n*   **Earnings Impact:** $NVDA levels are heavily influenced by recent earnings, with the $200 Call Wall acting as a powerful upside magnet and the $182.40 Gamma Flip serving as the primary line of defense for the current bullish regime.\n*   **Liquidity Gaps (Gamma Voids):** For $MSFT and $META, the regions between current spot and their respective Call Walls represent \"gamma voids\" where thin liquidity can lead to accelerated price moves during squeeze events. $AAPL shows a notable downside void between $270 and its $260 Max Pain target."
