Volatility is capped by heavy call-side pinning at the walls.\n*   **MSFT/META**: These names are currently seeing high institutional hedging activity. **MSFT** shows significant call resistance at **$425**, while **META**'s put wall at **$715** suggests protective positioning ahead of realized volatility expansion.\n*   **AVGO/AMZN**: Net GEX data for the 2026 cycle is more fragmented; however, **AVGO** maintains a strong psychological and options-based anchor at the **$330** level, which aligns precisely with its current Max Pain point. **AMZN** lacks a defined dealer wall for the current weekly expiration, defaulting to its **$235** Max Pain magnet."
