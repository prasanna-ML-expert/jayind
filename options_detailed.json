Gamma voids represent \"air pockets\" in market structure where dealer hedging is minimal, typically resulting in accelerated price velocity once the underlying enters these zones.\n\nOKLO:95,83.39,55,80,85-94,60-75; SMR:20,17.5,15,17,18.5-19.5,15.5-16.5; NNE:35,31.5,25,32,33-34.5,26-28; IMSR:15,12.5,10,12.5,13-14.5,10.5-12; UEC:20,16.5,15,16.5,17.5-19.5,15.5-16.2; CCJ:130,117,95,117,120-128,100-110; LEU:300,280,250,300,285-295,255-275; BWXT:0,0,0,0,0,0;\n\n### **Forensic Analyst Notes:**\n*   **$OKLO:** Dealers are currently in a \"long gamma\" regime above the **83.39** pivot, which serves as a dampener for volatility. A move below **77.74** triggers a volatility expansion as dealers shift to short gamma, potentially seeking the **55** put wall floor.\n*   **$SMR:** Significant call concentration at **$17** acts as a magnet for the weekly expiration. The \"Gamma Void\" above **18.5** suggests that if resistance is breached, a \"gamma squeeze\" toward the **$20** call wall is structurally probable.\n*   **$LEU:** The massive concentration at the **$300** strike creates a \"sticky\" pin risk. The downside void between **255-275** reflects a lack of dealer support if the **280** pivot is lost, leading to rapid mean reversion.\n*   **$BWXT:** Due to limited liquidity in the nearest weekly/monthly chains and lack of actionable Open Interest at the forensic level, structural barriers are currently unavailable (0).",

When trading above this pivot, dealers are net long gamma, which dampens volatility as they sell into strength and buy into dips. Below this pivot, dealers become net short gamma, forced to \"chase\" price by selling into weakness, which accelerates downside moves.\n*   **Gamma Voids:** The identified **Gamma Void** ranges represent \"liquidity deserts\" where there is minimal open interest to act as a buffer. Should the price break the Call or Put walls, the move through these void ranges is often rapid and \"slippery\" due to the lack of counter-party hedging flow.\n*   **Max Pain Influence:** With the exception of **AAPL** and **MSFT**, which show a wider divergence, most tickers are gravitating toward their **Max Pain** points, suggesting a \"pinning\" effect heading into the weekly Friday close as market makers seek to minimize the total payout on expiring contracts."
