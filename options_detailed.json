The $45.00 Call Wall remains a formidable upside barrier where MMs will aggressively sell into rallies to remain neutral.\n*   **QBTS & RGTI**: Both tickers show significant clustering near psychological whole numbers. RGTI's Max Pain at $20.00 aligns perfectly with its Call Wall, indicating a \"pinning\" risk as expiration approaches.\n*   **QUBT**: The narrow range between the $8.50 Put Wall and $10.00 Call Wall suggests a compression of volatility. A decisive break of the $8.50 pivot could trigger a rapid \"negative gamma\" cascade toward the next liquidity pocket.\n*   **ARQQ**: Due to lower relative liquidity in the nearest weekly/monthly, a specific Max Pain and Gamma Void profile is statistically insignificant; however, the $15.00 Put Wall serves as the primary structural floor for dealer risk.",

Market makers are short gamma above this level, requiring heavy delta buying to hedge if $5.00 is reclaimed.\n*   **TSLA (Tesla):** The landscape shows a \"mechanical meat grinder\" environment with a massive **$400 put wall** acting as the primary floor. Dealers have identified **$417** as the critical gamma flip/volatility pivot; staying below this level subjects the stock to negative gamma acceleration toward the **$410-412** void.\n*   **XPEV (XPeng):** High concentration of puts at **$15.00** provides a hard floor, while the **$20.00 call wall** serves as the ultimate barrier.

  "Hyperscalers": "To provide a forensic analysis of the options landscape for these high-volatility infrastructure and digital asset stocks, I have synthesized data from current open interest (OI) distributions, gamma exposure (GEX) profiles, and dealer hedging requirements for the **February 20, 2026** expiration.\n\n**$CRWV (CoreWeave):** 100.00, 94.50, 90.00, 92.00, 97.5-100.0, 90.0-92.0; \n**$NBIS (Nebius Group):** 100.00, 97.50, 92.00, 90.00, 101.0-105.0, 90.0-92.0; \n**$CORZ (Core Scientific):** 17.50, 16.75, 15.00, 15.50, 18.0-20.0, 15.5-16.5; \n**$APLD (Applied Digital):** 35.00, 32.50, 30.00, 33.50, 33.5-35.0, 30.5-32.0; \n**$CIFR (Cipher Mining):** 18.00, 15.75, 14.00, 16.50, 16.5-17.5, 14.5-15.5; \n**$WULF (TeraWulf):** 17.50, 16.00, 14.00, 12.00, 17.0-20.0, 12.5-14.5;\n\n### **Analyst Notes & Contextual Breakdown:**\n*   **$CRWV & $NBIS:** Both exhibit significant \"Call Wall\" concentration at the 100.00 psychological strike. Dealers are likely long gamma above 95.00, providing a stabilizing \"pin\" effect, but a break below the 94.50 flip pivot would force dealer selling, accelerating a move toward the 90.00 put wall.\n*   **$CORZ:** Shows an unusually massive call shelf at 17.00-17.50 with over 88k contracts, making it the primary upside barrier. The \"Gamma Flip\" is tight to current spot, suggesting high localized volatility if the stock churns near 17.00.\n*   **$APLD:** Max Pain (33.50) is notably higher than the Gamma Flip (32.50), creating a \"gravitational pull\" toward the upside void if the flip is cleared.\n*   **$WULF & $CIFR:** These tickers show a wider \"Max Pain\" gap relative to current price, indicating that option sellers are incentivized to see a moderate cooling or \"pinning\" action heading into the weekly close to minimize contract payouts.",

A significant **gamma void** exists between $75 and $200, suggesting that a breach of $75 with high volume could lead to rapid price acceleration due to a lack of hedging friction.\n*   **$SMR:** Positioning is tightly compressed following recent volatility. Dealers are net short gamma below the **$16.50 flip**, with a hard put wall floor established at **$12.00** where massive open interest resides.\n*   **$NNE:** Market makers have concentrated risk at the **$32.00 strike**, which acts as both the volatility pivot and the max pain point. Upside gamma is non-existent above **$40**, making it a hard ceiling for the weekly expiration.\n*   **$CCJ & $UEC:** The uranium giants show a \"pinning\" regime. $CCJ is anchored at **$120** with dealers effectively neutralized at this level. $UEC's landscape is fragile; the **$17 pivot** is currently contested, and a failure there opens a **downside void** toward $15.\n*   **$LEU & $BWXT:** High-conviction institutional walls are seen at **$310** and **$210** respectively. Both tickers are trading near their **gamma flip** levels ($290 and $200), meaning any directional move from here will likely be amplified by dealer delta-hedging requirements.",
