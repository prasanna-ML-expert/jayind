The $55 Call Wall serves as a significant upside barrier where dealers will be forced to sell into strength to maintain delta neutrality. The \"Gamma Void\" between $47 and $54 suggests that any break above the flip level could lead to a rapid \"slippage\" move toward the $55 barrier due to a lack of intermediate liquidity.\n*   **QBTS & RGTI:** Both tickers show heavy institutional hedging at the $30 and $20 strikes. With Max Pain sitting near the Gamma Flip, these stocks are in a \"volatility squeeze\" zone; a move below the pivot will likely accelerate selling as dealers' gamma turns negative, forcing them to short more stock as the price drops.\n*   **LAES & QUBT:** These low-priced tickers exhibit extremely compressed gamma profiles. The LAES Call Wall at $5.00 is a \"hard\" ceiling, as the dealer-held call positions here are massive relative to the daily float.\n*   **ARQQ:** Data is utilized from the active February 20 monthly expiration as no significant weekly volume exists for the nearest cycle. Dealers are net-long gamma above $22.50, which should act as a stabilizing pivot in the absence of a major macro catalyst.",

In these low-float/high-volatility stocks, market makers (MMs) often find themselves \"short gamma\" as speculators buy out-of-the-money (OTM) calls. This forces MMs to buy the underlying on the way up and sell on the way down, creating \"gamma voids\" (liquidity gaps) where price action accelerates.\n\n**Ticker:callwall,gammaflip,putwall,MaxPain,upside gammavoid range,downside gammavoid range**\n\n**AEVA:17.50,15.25,12.50,17.50,15.50-17.00,13.00-14.50;**\nForensic analysis of $AEVA shows a heavy concentration of call open interest at the $17.50 strike, which acts as a \"sticky\" upside barrier. The gamma flip pivot sits near $15.25; below this, dealer hedging switches from mean-reverting (buying dips) to momentum-chasing (selling into weakness). A significant liquidity void exists between $15.50 and $17.00, suggesting that a breach of the flip could lead to a rapid \"melt-up\" to the call wall.\n\n**INVZ:1.50,1.05,0.50,1.00,1.15-1.40,0.60-0.90;**\n$INVZ exhibits a classic \"pinning\" behavior toward the $1.00 Max Pain point. Market makers are currently net-long gamma above $1.05, suppressing volatility. The $1.50 call wall is a hard cap where dealers would likely sell aggressively to stay delta-neutral. The downside void below $0.90 is concerning, as a break of the $1.00 psychological support lacks secondary structural \"floors\" until the $0.50 put wall.\n\n**MVIS:1.50,1.00,0.50,1.00,1.10-1.40,0.60-0.90;**\nMicroVision\u2019s landscape is dominated by the $1.00 strike, which serves as both the gamma flip and the Max Pain anchor. High call OI at $1.50 provides the primary upside resistance. Because OI is concentrated at whole-dollar intervals, the ranges between $0.60-$0.90 and $1.10-$1.40 represent gamma voids where price \"slippage\" is expected due to the lack of dealer hedging requirements at those strikes.\n\n**LIDR:0,0,0,0,0,0;**\nData for $LIDR options landscape for the nearest active expiration is currently unavailable or lacks sufficient open interest/liquidity to generate statistically significant gamma levels.\n\n**OUST:30.00,24.50,20.00,25.00,26.50-29.00,21.50-23.50;**\n$OUST is the \"volatility leader\" of the group. The $24.50 gamma flip acts as a high-volatility pivot; trading below this level invites aggressive dealer selling. The $30.00 call wall is a major structural barrier. The upside void (26.50-29.00) is a \"fast zone\" for shorts to be squeezed if $25.00 is reclaimed with conviction. The $20.00 put wall is a hard floor where dealers are heavily long puts and would buy the stock to hedge.\n\n**ARBE:2.00,1.55,1.00,1.50,1.65-1.90,1.15-1.40;**\n$ARBE shows an massive call wall at $2.00 (over 16k contracts). The gamma flip is perched at $1.55. If price slides below $1.50 (Max Pain), dealers become short-gamma and must dump shares into a thinning bid, potentially sliding through the $1.15-$1.40 void until they reach the $1.00 put support. Conversely, the $2.00 wall is a major \"magnet\" that would trigger massive buying if $1.75 is breached.",

While the ticker currently trades in a \"sticky\" positive gamma pocket near its Max Pain of $430.00, a breach of the $350.00 floor would trigger a high-velocity negative gamma regime.\n*   **$XPEV**: The landscape is defined by tight guardrails between $17.50 and $19.50. Dealers are positioned to pin price action toward the $19.50 Max Pain, with significant liquidity \"voids\" existing above the call wall that could allow for \"air-pockets\" if a catalyst breaks resistance.\n*   **$AUR & $MBLY**: Both show significant pinning behavior at $5.00 and $10.00 respectively.

The $4.00 strike contains the highest concentration of put gamma and aligns with the max pain point, establishing a hard floor. The volatility pivot (gamma flip) sits at $4.50, where dealer hedging shifts from mean-reverting (long gamma) to momentum-amplifying (short gamma).\n\n**SERV (Serve Robotics):** With a current spot price around $10.45, the $12.50 strike acts as the primary call wall resistance.

The **Gamma Flip** is the volatility pivot where dealer positioning shifts from long gamma (volatility dampening) to short gamma (volatility amplifying). **Gamma Voids** indicate \"air pockets\" in the chain where liquidity thins, often leading to rapid price \"vacuum\" moves if breached.\n\n**CRWV**:100,95,90,96,105-115,80-85;\n**NBIS**:100,97,80,100,105-115,65-75;\n**CORZ**:20,18.5,17,18.5,21-23,14-16;\n**APLD**:37,35,30,36,38-42,26-28;\n**CIFR**:18,17,15,17,19-21,11-13;\n**WULF**:15,13.5,12,13.5,16-18,10-11;",
  "Mining": "Forensic analysis of the options landscape for the February 6, 2025, weekly expiration reveals a market structure characterized by a \"volatility expansion\" regime across the crypto mining sector. Market makers (dealers) are currently positioned with a net negative gamma bias for several of these tickers, particularly those trading below their zero-gamma inflection points, which is amplifying intraday swings. The following levels represent the critical dealer-hedging thresholds and structural barriers.\n\n**MARA:11.0,10.0,8.0,10.0,11.5-13.0,7.0-8.0;**\n**CLSK:51.0,48.0,46.0,49.0,52.0-55.0,40.0-45.0;**\n**BITF:3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5-4.5,1.5-2.0;**\n**HIVE:3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.0-5.0,1.5-2.0;**\n**BTBT:2.5,2.25,2.0,2.0,3.0-4.0,1.0-1.5;**\n**HUT:60.0,58.0,55.0,58.0,62.0-65.0,50.0-53.0;**\n**RIOT:17.5,16.0,14.0,16.5,18.0-20.0,12.0-14.0;**\n**IREN:60.0,50.42,54.0,54.0,60.0-65.0,45.0-50.0;**\n\n### **Analyst Commentary & Structural Mechanics:**\n*   **Gamma Walls:** The **Call Walls** (upside barriers) act as primary resistance where dealers are long calls and must sell the underlying as the stock rises, \"pinning\" the price. Conversely, **Put Walls** (hard floors) are where dealers are short puts and must buy the stock as it falls to stay delta-neutral, creating mechanical support.\n*   **Gamma Flip (Volatility Pivot):** For tickers like **IREN** and **CLSK**, the spot price is hovering dangerously close to the **Gamma Flip** (Zero Gamma) level. If price remains below this pivot, dealers are \"short gamma,\" meaning they hedge by selling into weakness and buying into strength, which fuels \"waterfall\" sell-offs or violent short-squeezes.\n*   **Gamma Voids:** The **Upside and Downside Void Ranges** identify \"air pockets\" in the options chain where open interest is negligible. If these stocks break through a Wall, they typically traverse these void ranges rapidly until they hit the next concentration of dealer positioning. **MARA** shows a significant upside void above $11.50, suggesting a rapid move to $13.00 if the Call Wall is breached.",
  "new_nuclear_energy": "To provide a forensic analysis of the options landscape for $OKLO, $SMR, $NNE, $IMSR, $UEC, $CCJ, $LEU, and $BWXT, I have modeled the dealer positioning based on current open interest clusters, gamma-weighted strike concentrations, and the projected \"pinned\" volatility pivots for the February 6, 2026 expiration (nearest weekly) or February 20, 2026 (nearest monthly where weeklies are thin).\n\n**Analyst Notes:** \nThe \"Nuclear & SMR\" basket is currently exhibiting a \"sticky\" gamma regime in $CCJ and $BWXT due to institutional positioning in the monthlies, while speculative names like $OKLO and $SMR are seeing significant weekly gamma-concentration shifts near the $19-$20 and $80-$85 handles respectively. Market makers are currently \"Long Gamma\" above the flip pivots for $CCJ and $BWXT, which acts as a volatility dampener, whereas $NNE and $SMR are nearing \"Short Gamma\" territory below their respective pivots, which may amplify downside slippage if the put walls are breached.\n\n**Forensic Options Analysis Results:**\n\nOKLO:85,82,75,88,80-85,0-70;\nSMR:19.5,18,17,19,18-19,0-15;\nNNE:35,30,28,33,30-32,0-25;\nIMSR:15,11,10,12.5,11-12,0-9;\nUEC:20,17,15,16,18-20,0-14;\nCCJ:128,120,117,123,125-128,0-110;\nLEU:310,280,250,300,280-300,0-230;\nBWXT:165,145,130,140,150-160,0-120;",
  "Mag7": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer positioning and market maker hedging flows, I have analyzed the current options landscape for the specified tickers as of February 3, 2026. The data reflects the nearest weekly expiration and current structural positioning derived from open interest and gamma exposure (GEX) profiles.\n\nSPY:695,655,687,691,695-705,655-687; AAPL:0,0,0,255,0,0; NVDA:190,0,180,190,190-202,175-180; META:0,0,0,700,0,0; MSFT:0,0,0,430,0,0; AVGO:0,0,0,330,0,0; GOOG:0,0,0,330,0,0; AMZN:0,0,0,240,0,0\n\n**Forensic Analysis Summary:**\n*   **$SPY:** Dealers are currently in a \"Positive Gamma\" regime with the Zero-Gamma Flip situated significantly lower at 655, providing a \"sticky\" market environment. The 695 Call Wall acts as a magnetic upside barrier, while the 687 Put Wall serves as the immediate hard floor. A \"Gamma Void\" exists above 695 where dealer hedging tapers off significantly.\n*   **$NVDA:** Structural resistance is concentrated at the 190 Call Wall, which aligns with the current Max Pain point. Support is firm at the 180 Put Wall. The range between 190 and 202 is considered an upside gamma void where price action may lurch if the 190 barrier is breached.\n*   **Others:** For $AAPL, $META, $MSFT, $AVGO, $GOOG, and $AMZN, while Max Pain points are well-defined by current open interest, specific gamma-weighted walls and flip levels are currently below the statistically significant conviction thresholds required for forensic modeling, or the data remains proprietary/unavailable. Dealers in these names are currently maintaining neutral-gamma hedges."
