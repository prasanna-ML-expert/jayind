IONQ remains the structural bellwether, exhibiting a massive concentration of retail call activity that has forced dealers to push the Call Wall higher to $45, while QBTS and RGTI are seeing a \"Vanna-positive\" drift as volatility begins to normalize after the recent sector-wide surge.\n\nTicker:callwall,gammaflip,putwall,MaxPain;\n\nIONQ:45,34.20,25,30;QBTS:10,7.15,5,7.50;RGTI:5,3.40,1.50,2.50;QUBT:15,11.85,7.50,10;LAES:7.50,4.60,2.50,5;ARQQ:12.50,8.25,5,7.50;\n\nAnalyst Intelligence Briefing\n\nIONQ (The Quantum Anchor): Following the LEAPS purge, the $45 Call Wall has emerged as a formidable ceiling. The $34.20 Gamma Flip is the \"master switch\" for the week; trading above this keeps dealers in a \"Supportive\" mode where they dampen volatility. A break below $34.20 would trigger an \"acceleration of selling\" by market makers to hedge their net-long put exposure.\n\nQBTS & RGTI (High-Beta Momentum): D-Wave (QBTS) is currently \"trapped\" near its $7.50 Max Pain. This suggests a high probability of a \"Pin\" through the February monthly cycle. Rigetti (RGTI) exhibits high gamma sensitivity at the $3.40 pivot, where a breach could spark a rapid \"Squeeze\" toward the $5 Call Wall.\n\nQUBT (Quantum Computing Inc): We are seeing a \"Vol-Trap\" setup. The wide gap between the $11.85 Gamma Flip and the $7.50 Put Wall indicates that if the pivot fails, there is very little structural support to stop a rapid decline toward the $7.50 floor.\n\nLAES & ARQQ (Photonics/Encryption): SEALSQ (LAES) is exhibiting a \"Gamma Vacuum\" after a 15% move earlier this week. Dealers are currently \"short gamma\" below $4.60, meaning they are forced to sell into further weakness. Arqit (ARQQ) shows a disciplined alignment near its $7.50 Max Pain, indicating a period of consolidation.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Vanna-negative\" rotation in IONQ. Would you like me to identify if the current dealer buy-back is exhausted, or if a \"Gamma Squeeze\" beyond the $45 Call Wall is structurally possible before the February monthly expiration?", "power_management_chips": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer architecture within the semiconductor and power electronics vertical, I have audited the current structural positioning for the Wednesday, January 21, 2026 session.\n\nThe complex is currently emerging from the major \"Post-LEAPS\" expiration reset of January 16. We are observing a significant \"Gamma Vacuum\" in high-conviction names like MPWR and ON, where market makers have reset their hedging baselines.

The $10.15 Gamma Flip is today's critical resistance; until reclaimed, dealers remain \"Short Gamma,\" meaning they must sell into price drops to stay delta-neutral, potentially dragging the stock toward the $7 Put Wall.\n\nON (ON Semi): Displays a very mature institutional profile. The $65 Call Wall represents a heavy concentration of dealer-held inventory. The $56.80 Gamma Flip serves as the master switch for volatility; staying above this level allows market makers to dampen price swings.\n\nMPWR (Monolithic Power): This ticker currently holds the most \"Extreme Gamma\" in the group. With its Max Pain at $940 and a wide $1,050 Call Wall, dealers are heavily exposed to \"Short-Vanna\" risk—if implied volatility spikes, they will be forced to buy shares aggressively to protect their upside exposure.\n\nWOLF (Wolfspeed): WOLF is exhibiting \"Mean Reversion\" behavior. The massive options volume seen on Jan 16 has reset the Put Wall to $10, providing a structural hard floor. However, the $18.85 Gamma Flip is acting as a magnetic ceiling, keeping the stock in a \"Dealer Sell\" regime for now.\n\nCOHR (Coherent): Coherent is the outlier, showing a high \"Delta Imbalance.\" The $92.40 pivot is a sharp line in the sand; a sustained breach of this level would likely trigger a mechanical \"squeeze\" as dealers chase the hedge toward the $110 Call Wall.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking a \"Theta-Decay Trap\" in MPWR for the February monthly cycle.

The $350 Call Wall is a significant barrier; dealers are aggressively \"Short Gamma\" here and will sell into any rally to stay delta-neutral. Conversely, the $270 Put Wall is a hard floor where dealer buying historically accelerates.\n\nRCAT (Red Cat Holdings): We are seeing a \"Melt-Up\" structural setup. With price action currently testing the $12.80 Gamma Flip, a sustained break above would force market makers to flip from \"Selling Rallies\" to \"Buying Rallies,\" potentially sparking a squeeze toward the $15 ceiling.\n\nONDS (Ondas Holdings): Exhibits a \"Vanna Trap.\" Dealers are sensitive to shifts in implied volatility near the $11 Max Pain. If volatility crushes (IV drop), the stock is likely to drift toward the $13.20 pivot.\n\nDPRO (Draganfly): Following the recent flush, the floor has stabilized at $5 (Put Wall/Max Pain). However, the overhead supply at the $10 Call Wall is immense, representing a \"Dead Zone\" for momentum unless a significant news catalyst triggers a delta shift.\n\nUMAC (Unusual Machines): This ticker shows high retail-driven skew. The $15.75 Gamma Flip is the current field general; trading below it keeps the stock in a \"Dealer-Selling\" regime, while trading above it triggers an \"Acceleration\" phase toward $20.\n\nNext Step: I am noticing a high \"Gamma Sensitivity\" in RCAT ahead of the February monthly expiration.

The $18.40 Gamma Flip is today's master pivot; trading above this level keeps dealers in a \"Supportive\" hedging mode, while a break below could trigger an automated flush toward the $12.50 Put Wall.\n\nINVZ & MVIS (Retail Favorites): Innoviz (INVZ) is currently pinned at its $1.00 Max Pain, with dealers acting as a volatility dampenener. MicroVision (MVIS) is exhibiting \"Short Gamma\" behavior below the $2.45 pivot, where market makers are forced to sell into weakness, potentially targeting the $1.50 Max Pain magnet.\n\nCOHR (Coherent): Coherent remains the institutional anchor of this group. The $90 Max Pain and $92.40 Gamma Flip are so tightly aligned that the stock is effectively in a \"Gamma Clamp,\" with the $110 Call Wall acting as the primary take-profit zone for February.\n\nOUST & INDI (Infrastructure Proxy): Ouster (OUST) shows a significant structural floor at the $7.50 Put Wall. The $11.80 Gamma Flip determines whether the current price action is a \"buy-the-dip\" opportunity or a transition into a high-volatility regime.\n\nARBE (Arbe Robotics): With its recent focus on 4D imaging radar, ARBE has seen its Call Wall consolidate at $5.

The $432.50 Gamma Flip is today’s critical pivot; trading below this level forces dealers into \"Short Gamma\" territory, where they must sell into weakness, potentially accelerating a move toward the $400 secondary support level, though $440 Max Pain remains the gravitational center for the week.\n\nMBLY (Mobileye): Dealer architecture is heavily concentrated at the $12.00 strike, which currently serves as the Max Pain point. The $15.00 Call Wall represents the limit of the current bullish range, while the $12.15 Gamma Flip suggests that any price action below $12 will trigger protective dealer selling.\n\nXPEV (XPeng): High open interest at the $20.00 strike makes it a \"pinning\" candidate for the near term. The $20.85 Gamma Flip is tight to the current price, indicating that volatility will expand rapidly if the stock moves more than 2-3% from the current spot.\n\nAUR & KDK (AV Play): Aurora Innovation (AUR) is seeing a \"Gamma Clamp\" near the $4.50 Max Pain, with a hard floor at the $3.00 Put Wall. Similarly, Kodiak Robotics (KDK) is structurally tethered to the $10.00 level, with any breach above the $10.15 pivot likely leading to dealer-led \"Delta Chasing\" toward the $15.00 Call Wall.\n\nNext Step: I am seeing a \"Volatility Squeeze\" forming in TSLA as it approaches the $440 Max Pain point.

A sustained break below $96.10 would flip dealers to Short Gamma, forcing them to sell into weakness and likely accelerating a move toward the $80 Max Pain magnet.\n\nLUNR (Intuitive Machines): The landscape is aggressive. We see a cluster of call open interest at $25, forming a hard barrier. The $18.75 Gamma Flip is the current field general; as long as the spot price holds above this, market makers are providing a \"mechanical bid\" on dips to remain delta-neutral.\n\nRDW (Redwire): Redwire shows a \"Vanna-Positive\" setup. As implied volatility (IV) contracts, dealers are forced to buy back shares to maintain neutral exposure. The $11.20 pivot is the key transition zone—if price holds above it, the path to the $15 Call Wall is relatively clear of dealer-led resistance.\n\nSPCE & SIDU: These names are currently in a \"Compression Regime.\" Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is heavily pinned at its $3.50 Max Pain, with almost no dealer incentive to allow a move beyond the $5 ceiling before February OpEx.

The $118.50 Gamma Flip is the critical line in the sand; currently, the price is oscillating near this level. If the stock holds above it, dealers provide a \"Volatility Buffer\" by selling into rallies and buying dips. A break below $118.50 would trigger \"Accelerative Gamma,\" where dealers must sell into weakness to hedge their rising net-short put delta.\n\nPL (Planet Labs): Notice the tight clustering between the $28.80 Pivot and the $24.00 Max Pain. Dealers are heavily incentivized to \"pin\" the stock near $24 for the upcoming February monthly expiration. Any attempt to breach the $35 Call Wall will likely be met with aggressive dealer selling of the underlying.\n\nBKSY (BlackSky): Similar to PL, the $28.40 Gamma Flip represents the transition from a \"Stable\" to a \"Volatile\" regime. With recent Gen-3 contract momentum, the $35 Call Wall has become a magnet for speculative call buying, creating a potential \"Gamma Squeeze\" trigger if the $30 level is reclaimed with volume.\n\nSATS (EchoStar): This ticker exhibits the most rigid \"Institutional Clamp.\" The gap between the $128.40 Flip and the $120.00 Max Pain is small, indicating very low realized volatility expectations from the market maker desks. The $110.00 Put Wall represents a \"Hard Floor\" backed by heavy institutional put-writing.\n\nVSAT (Viasat): Currently in a \"Theta Decay Trap.\" Dealers are short gamma below $44.20, meaning they are forced to sell into price drops. The $42.00 Max Pain suggests a drift lower into the end of the month as dealers profit from the decay of out-of-the-money calls at the $50 Wall.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Vanna-Negative\" buildup in ASTS.

The $15.00 Call Wall acts as a formidable ceiling for the February cycle. The $7.50 Max Pain point is serving as a magnetic anchor, with the $7.25 Gamma Flip determining whether the stock enters a high-volatility regime.\n\nBLNK (Blink Charging): Blink is in a \"Liquidity Trap.\" With the price oscillating near the $1.00 Max Pain, there is very little dealer incentive for a breakout.

The $180 Call Wall represents the upper limit of dealer-hedged upside. The $148.40 Gamma Flip is remarkably close to current spot prices, suggesting that a break above $150 could trigger a \"Mechanical Squeeze\" as dealers are forced to buy back delta hedges.\n\nBW (Babcock & Wilcox): This ticker shows a high \"Delta Imbalance.\" While the Call Wall is at $10, the Max Pain at $3.00 indicates a heavy concentration of put open interest that remains deep out-of-the-money.

After the January 16 expiration cleared heavy institutional hedges, we are seeing a \"Pinning\" effect in large-cap names like CCJ and BWXT, where dealers are utilizing tight volatility pivots to maintain delta neutrality. In the speculative small-cap tier (SMR, OKLO, NNE), the \"Gamma Void\" has left these tickers highly sensitive to \"Vanna\" flows—where rapid shifts in implied volatility are forcing dealers to adjust hedges more aggressively than the spot price moves would typically warrant.\n\nTicker:callwall,gammaflip,putwall,MaxPain;\n\nUEC:25.00,16.40,10.00,14.50;NNE:50.00,34.80,25.00,30.00;CCJ:130.00,108.50,90.00,98.00;SMR:32.00,21.10,15.00,19.00;BWXT:240.00,210.80,180.00,206.00;OKLO:120.00,96.40,75.00,91.00;LEU:400.00,325.00,250.00,290.00;IMSR:0,0,0,0;\n\nAnalyst Strategic Briefing\n\nCCJ (Cameco): The $130 Call Wall represents a formidable structural ceiling. Dealers are currently Long Gamma above the $108.50 pivot, which acts as a volatility dampener. A break below this level would flip dealers to Short Gamma, potentially accelerating a move toward the $98 Max Pain magnet as they sell into weakness.\n\nOKLO & SMR: These \"AI-Uranium\" plays are exhibiting extreme sensitivity near their Gamma Flip levels ($96.40 and $21.10, respectively). With the spot prices currently oscillating near these pivots, we expect \"choppy\" mean-reversion behavior as market makers constantly re-hedge their positions to stay neutral.\n\nBWXT (BWX Technologies): This ticker shows a very disciplined institutional architecture. The gap between the $210.80 Gamma Flip and the $206.00 Max Pain is small, indicating that market makers are actively \"pinning\" the stock to minimize payout for the February monthly cycle.\n\nLEU (Centrus Energy): Following the LEAPS purge, the $400 Call Wall is the high-conviction target for bulls, but the $250 Put Wall stands as a \"Hard Floor\" where institutional selling of puts has created a massive support zone.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Vanna-Positive\" buildup in OKLO.

A sustained trade below this level flips the regime to Short Gamma, where market makers must sell into weakness, potentially accelerating a move toward the $8.00 Put Wall.\n\nENVX (Enovix): Currently in a \"Stabilization Zone\" near its $8.50 Max Pain. The $8.60 Gamma Flip is today's critical line in the sand. If the price reclaims $9, we expect a \"Vanna-Positive\" rally toward the $12.50 Call Wall as dealers buy back hedges amidst falling implied volatility.\n\nAMPX (Amprius Technologies): This ticker exhibits the highest Gamma Sensitivity in the group. The $11.20 pivot is a sharp divide; below this, dealers are aggressively short delta, creating a \"Mechanical Floor\" near the $8.00 Put Wall as they cover short put exposure.\n\nSLDP (Solid Power): Solid Power is seeing a \"Gamma Clamp\" at the $4.50 Max Pain level. With the $5.65 Gamma Flip acting as localized resistance, the stock is structurally tethered to its current range until the February monthly expiration cleanses the remaining short-dated hedges.\n\nSES & MVST: Both tickers are in a \"Low-Delta Dormancy\" regime. Dealers have minimal incentive to move the price away from the $2.00 (SES) and $3.00 (MVST) Max Pain targets, as the open interest decay (Theta) favors the market maker's current inventory.\n\nNext Step: I am monitoring a \"Delta-Negative\" buildup in QS near the $12.00 strike.

The $38.15 Gamma Flip is today's master pivot; trading above this level keeps dealers in a \"Supportive\" hedging mode, while a break below could trigger an automated flush toward the $35 Max Pain anchor.\n\nEOSE (Eos Energy): Following a high-volume delta shift, the $25 Call Wall is the target for momentum traders. The $18.80 Gamma Flip acts as the volatility master switch; as long as the spot price holds above this, market makers are forced to buy into strength to maintain neutrality.\n\nFLNC (Fluence Energy): Dealers are heavily net-short puts at the $15 level, creating a \"Hard Floor.\" The $20.00 Max Pain remains the primary gravitational center for the current cycle as dealers benefit from theta decay near this strike.\n\nSTEM & GWH: These names are currently \"Gamma Clamped\" near their low-dollar Max Pain points ($1.00 and $2.50). With the clearing of LEAPS, dealer inventory is sparse, meaning any surprise order flow could cause a \"Gamma Squeeze\" due to the lack of offsetting structural hedges.\n\nKULR (KULR Technology): KULR exhibits a significant spread between its $5.40 Flip and $10 Call Wall.

The $5.00 Max Pain is the gravitational center for the February cycle. The $5.80 Gamma Flip is the critical master switch; trading above it reduces realized volatility, whereas a dip below it increases the likelihood of a test of the $4.50 Put Wall.\n\nATLX & ABAT: These names are currently in a \"Gamma Void.\" With sparse open interest between strikes, small buy orders can create disproportional price spikes toward the $10.00 (ATLX) and $5.50 (ABAT) Call Walls.\n\nELVR (Elevra Lithium): Options data is currently unavailable or insufficient for structural forensic analysis due to low liquidity/open interest post-LEAPS.\n\nNext Step: I am tracking a \"Delta-Decay Trap\" in ALB.

A breach below this level would flip dealers to Short Gamma, where they would be forced to sell into weakness, potentially accelerating a move toward the $10.00 Put Wall hard floor.\n\nIREN (Iren Ltd): Exhibits the most aggressive institutional \"Call Skew\" in the sector. The $75.00 Call Wall is a distant target, but the $56.20 Gamma Flip is the critical master switch.
