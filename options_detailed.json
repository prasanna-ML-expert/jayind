  "quantum": "As a forensic equity options analyst specializing in dealer positioning and market maker (MM) hedging mechanics, the following landscape identifies the key structural levels for the January 30, 2026, weekly expiration. These levels represent the \"gravity\" points where dealer hedging transitions from delta-neutral maintenance to volatility-inducing gamma exposure.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the **Call Wall** (upper resistance barrier where MM selling of the underlying stock caps upside), **Gamma Flip** (the pivot point where MMs switch from providing liquidity/suppressing volatility to chasing price/expanding volatility), **Put Wall** (the structural \"hard floor\" where MM hedging creates a buying cushion), **Max Pain** (the strike where the most options value expires worthless), and **Gamma Void** (liquidity \"air pockets\" where price moves are most likely to accelerate due to lack of open interest).\n\n**IONQ: 50,47,40,47,43;**\n**QBTS: 27.5,26,26,26,24.5;**\n**RGTI: 23,23,22,24,21.5;**\n**QUBT: 13,11.5,11,11.5,10.5;**\n**LAES: 5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4;**\n**ARQQ: 0;**\n\n***\n\n**Forensic Breakdown:**\n*   **$IONQ:** The heavy Call Wall at **50** serves as a major psychological and structural ceiling. Dealers are currently in a \"positive gamma\" regime above **47**, which should dampen intraday volatility. The **43** level is a significant void, suggesting that if the **45** support fails, price action will rapidly gap toward the **40** Put Wall.\n*   **$QBTS:** The landscape is highly concentrated around the **26** strike, which acts as the Put Wall, Max Pain, and Gamma Flip. This indicates a \"pinning\" effect likely to keep the stock tethered to this level through expiration.\n*   **$RGTI:** Price action is currently testing the Gamma Flip at **23**. Trading below this level puts dealers into \"short gamma,\" meaning they must sell into weakness, potentially forcing a test of the **22** Put Wall.\n*   **$ARQQ:** This ticker does not currently have a listed weekly expiration for January 30, 2026 (options follow the standard monthly cycle); therefore, data for this specific window is unavailable."
