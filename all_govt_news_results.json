Single-Stock 2x or 3x Leveraged ETFs: Recent Launches and Filings**\n\nAs of January 20, 2026, a comprehensive search for recent SEC Form N-1A and 485BXT filings pertaining to single-stock 2x or 3x leveraged ETFs launched in the last 30 days (since December 21, 2025) or filed to launch in the next 3 weeks (until February 10, 2026), specifically for tickers that previously lacked such leveraged versions, did not yield direct, detailed results from the current search queries. The nature of these filings often requires direct querying of the SEC EDGAR database or reliance on financial news outlets that explicitly report such launches/filings with the specific details requested. The search results provided general market commentary and investment news, but not the granular data for an ETF analyst table. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested table at this time."
