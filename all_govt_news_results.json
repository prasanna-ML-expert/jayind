    "news": "Here's a breakdown of recent developments in quantum tech, drone tech, robotics, space tech, satellite communication, nuclear energy, and AI, including government initiatives, major company investments, and new leveraged ETF launches.\n\n## Government, DoD, DoE, and NASA Engagements in Advanced Technologies\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\n*   The Pentagon released an \"AI-first\" strategy on January 9, 2026, mandating an AI-first approach across all its components to maintain a competitive edge. This strategy includes seven \"Pace-Setting Projects\" aimed at rapid AI execution and infrastructure development, and a new procurement criterion requiring the latest AI models to be available to military users within 30 days of their public release.\n*   The Department of Defense (DoD) announced the inclusion of OpenAI's ChatGPT into its enterprise generative AI platform, GenAI.mil, following an earlier announcement that xAI's Grok would be integrated in early 2026.\n*   The Pentagon previously awarded $200 million contracts for \"frontier AI\" projects to OpenAI, xAI, Google, and Anthropic. However, the Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its $200 million contract with Anthropic, developer of the Claude AI model, due to a dispute over the company's refusal to allow its tools for autonomous weapons and mass surveillance, as the military pushes for AI models to be used for \"all lawful purposes.\" Google's Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, xAI's Grok, and Anthropic's Claude are the four primary AI models currently used by the Pentagon, with Claude being the only one authorized for classified documents.\n\n**Satellite Communication & Space Tech:**\n*   The U.S. Space Force awarded contracts totaling $37.2 million to Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Viasat, Intelsat, and Astranis for the Protected Tactical Satcom-Global (PTS-G) program. These six-month contracts, expected to conclude by January 2026, aim to advance system designs and demonstrations for a new geostationary constellation.\n*   The Space Force plans to select a PTS-G design and award a production contract in 2026 for the first satellite, slated for a 2028 launch, as part of a broader $4 billion indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract ceiling.\n*   The Space Force's fiscal year 2026 budget proposes $572 million for the entire PTS program.\n*   Additionally, the Space Force announced plans for a 2026 competition to access commercial maneuverable satellites in geosynchronous orbit for services including satellite communications, Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and environmental monitoring.\n\n**Nuclear Energy:**\n*   The Department of Energy's (DoE) Fiscal Year 2026 Budget allocates $1.37 billion to the Office of Nuclear Energy and $750 million in credit subsidy for the Loans Program Office. This funding is intended to accelerate the innovation and deployment of commercial nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors and advanced reactors.\n*   The DoE is seeking hosts for \"Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses,\" an announcement made on January 28, 2026.\n*   On January 5, 2026, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded $2.7 billion to restore American uranium enrichment capabilities.\n*   The Office of Nuclear Energy has funding opportunities for its \"Fiscal Year 2026 Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research\" program, open to U.S. universities, national laboratories, and industry entities, with deadlines for Letters of Intent and pre-applications in January 2026, and full applications due by June 9, 2026.\n\n## Magnificent 7 Companies and Prominent Investor Activities\n\n**Meta:**\n*   Meta is significantly increasing its AI-related spending in 2026, with projected capital expenditures between US$115 billion and US$135 billion, nearly doubling the previous year's investment. These investments are primarily focused on AI infrastructure and data centers.\n*   The company plans to invest over $600 billion in AI data centers across the U.S. by 2028. As part of this, Meta broke ground on a new 1-gigawatt data center in Lebanon, Indiana, an investment exceeding $10 billion, designed to support both AI workloads and core products.\n*   To power its expanding data center infrastructure, Meta is partnering with Vistra, Oklo, and TerraPower to secure up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity by 2035, with initial purchases from Vistra expected to begin in late 2026.\n*   Meta also signed a $6 billion deal with U.S. tech firm Corning on January 28, 2026, for AI data centers.\n\n**Tesla / Elon Musk:**\n*   Tesla announced plans to invest over $20 billion in 2026, primarily in AI infrastructure, its Robotaxi platform, and next-generation battery production, signaling a strategic shift towards becoming an AI and robotics company.\n*   Tesla is investing approximately $2 billion into Elon Musk's xAI initiative to enhance AI integration, including the use of xAI's Grok chatbot and supplying Megapacks for xAI projects.\n*   The company is retooling its Fremont factory, previously used for Model S and Model X production, to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots, with a long-term goal of 1 million robots per year.\n*   Elon Musk's SpaceX officially acquired xAI on February 2, 2026, through a stock swap, forming a combined entity valued at around $1.25 trillion. This merger aims to leverage Starlink's satellite network and develop orbital data centers to support xAI's AI development, addressing terrestrial data center limitations.\n*   SpaceX confirmed plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, potentially by July, to fund its expansion into AI infrastructure, including orbital data centers.\n\n**Nvidia:**\n*   Nvidia is poised to continue its significant role in the AI infrastructure boom in 2026, as major tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are collectively projecting $650-700 billion in capital expenditures, a substantial portion of which is allocated to GPUs, data centers, and AI compute.\n*   Nvidia invested roughly $53 billion across 170 deals within the AI ecosystem. In 2025 alone, its venture arm, NVentures, participated in nearly 67 venture rounds, including investments in AI model builders (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, xAI, Cohere), infrastructure providers (CoreWeave, Nscale, Nebius), autonomous driving (Wayve), robotics (Figure AI), quantum computing (Quantinuum), and nuclear fusion companies.\n*   Nvidia acquired a $2 billion equity stake in chip design tools company Synopsys in December 2025. The company is also developing new chips, such as Rubin (for AI inference) and Blackwell, to maintain its competitive edge.\n\n**Alphabet (Google):**\n*   Google's 2015 investment of approximately $900 million in SpaceX, for an estimated 7% stake, could be valued at around $111 billion if SpaceX proceeds with its anticipated 2026 IPO at a $1.5 trillion valuation. This investment holds strategic importance for AI infrastructure, leveraging the potential of space-based solar energy.\n*   Alphabet is collaborating with Planet Labs on \"Project Suncatcher,\" an initiative to launch space-based Google AI data centers by 2027.\n\n**Microsoft:**\n*   Microsoft spent over $50 billion on data centers in 2025 and is projected to have capital expenditures of approximately $140-145 billion in 2026, largely directed towards GPUs, data centers, and AI compute.\n\n**Amazon:**\n*   Amazon is forecasting $200 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, with a significant portion allocated to GPUs, data centers, and AI compute.\n\n**Sam Altman:**\n*   Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, reportedly explored acquiring a rocket company in 2025 to deploy satellites equipped with AI computing capabilities into space.\n\n## New 2x Leveraged Single-Stock ETFs (U.S. Markets)\n\nSeveral 2x leveraged single-stock ETFs have recently launched or are filed to launch in the U.S. markets.\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer          | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |\n| ASML Holding (ASML) | ASMU           | 2x Bull        | Direxion        | February 11, 2026     |\n| Alibaba Group (BABA) | BABU           | 2x Bull        | Direxion        | February 11, 2026     |\n| Marvell Technology, Inc.
