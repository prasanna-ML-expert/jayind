Announcements, News, Contracts, Projects, or Rumors by USA Governments, DOD, DOE, NASA, or Similar Organizations\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   The White House operationalized its AI action plan in February 2026, introducing export-ready \"American AI stack\" packages, a U.S. Tech Corps, and new standards initiatives aimed at cementing America's dominance in the global AI race. This includes a new Peace Corps initiative to dispatch volunteer technologists to assist partner governments with AI deployment and the National Champions Initiative to integrate leading AI firms from partner countries into customized export stacks built around U.S. components.\n*   The U.S. Department of the Treasury concluded a major public-private initiative in February 2026 to strengthen cybersecurity and risk management for AI in the financial services sector. A series of six resources developed with industry and federal/state regulatory partners will be released throughout February 2026 to enable secure and resilient AI across the U.S. financial system.\n*   The CISA's Roadmap for AI, initiated in August 2023, guides the U.S. government's efforts to defend critical infrastructure and government networks against AI-based software system risks.\n*   The National Science Foundation allocated $140 million in May 2023 to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes to promote responsible innovation and bolster the U.S.'s AI research and development (R&D) infrastructure.\n*   The Trump administration's \"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\" (January 2025) and \"Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan\" (July 2025) focus on an \"innovation-first\" approach to secure U.S. global AI dominance.\n*   Legislation like the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative (NAII) Act of 2020 and the AI in Government Act of 2020 promote and fund AI innovation across federal agencies.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   The Department of Energy (DOE) announced up to $800 million in cost-sharing funding in December 2025 to accelerate the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs), awarding funds to TVA and Holtec. TVA will build GE Vernova / Hitachi BWRX-300 reactors at its Clinch River site, and Holtec will deploy its SMR-300 units at the Palisades plant in Michigan.\n*   In November 2025, DOE announced the financial close of a $1 billion loan to Constellation to help finance the Crane Clean Energy Center Restart project, a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n*   The U.S. Government established a strategic partnership with Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management in October 2025 to accelerate the development of Westinghouse's nuclear reactor technologies.\n*   The DOE also selected 11 initial projects for President Trump's Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in August 2025, aiming for these advanced SMR technologies to achieve criticality by mid-2026. The program supports expedited licensing and permitting, rather than direct funding.\n*   Deep Fission secured $80 million on February 19, 2026, to fast-track the commercialization of subterranean nuclear reactor technology.\n*   Oklo secured an agreement on February 17, 2026, for 1.2 GW advanced nuclear energy development in southern Ohio.\n\n**Space Tech & Satellite Communication**\n*   Elon Musk's rocket venture, SpaceX, announced on February 2, 2026, that it had acquired xAI, merging his space exploration and artificial intelligence ventures into a single company. This combined entity is valued at $1.25 trillion and is expected to pursue a massive initial public offering later this year.\n*   The merger aims to build \"orbital data centers\" composed of satellites launched by SpaceX, utilizing xAI's technology to meet AI data center demand. SpaceX filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission last month for an \"orbital data center system\" that includes launching 1 million satellites into Earth's orbit. Musk anticipates that within 2 to 3 years, space-based AI will be the most cost-effective way to generate AI compute.\n\n### II. Investments by Magnificent 7 Companies or Prominent Investors\n\n**Microsoft (AI)**\n*   Microsoft unveiled approximately $23 billion in new AI investments on December 9, 2025, with a significant portion ($17.5 billion) directed towards building out AI infrastructure in India. This investment aims to establish Microsoft's largest cloud presence in India, with the first new data center going live mid-2026.\n*   The company is also investing over $5.42 billion in Canada over the next two years, with total estimated investment amounting to C$19 billion (S$17.8 billion) between 2023 and 2027.
