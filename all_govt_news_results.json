It also mandates a minimum of $55 million for NIST's existing AI measurement science programs and up to $10 million for the US Center for AI Standards and Innovation. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is allocated $8.75 billion, including $30 million for the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot.\n*   The DEFIANCE Act, legislation aimed at strengthening protections and accountability around AI-enabled sexual exploitation, was unanimously passed by the Senate and is now under consideration in the House.\n*   The Department of Defense (DoD) has requested $13.4 billion for AI and autonomy in FY2026, marking its largest single-year AI investment. This funding is directed towards operational AI implementation across autonomous systems, decision support platforms, and mission-critical applications.\n*   The Pentagon has instituted an \"AI-first\" mandate, fundamentally reshaping its approach to developing, acquiring, and deploying AI. This includes the establishment of seven high-priority \"Pace-Setting Projects\" (PSPs) designed for rapid execution and building foundational AI infrastructure.\n*   Meta projects its Q1 2026 total revenue to be between $53.5 billion and $56.5 billion, with significant capital expenditures guided between $115 billion and $135 billion, primarily driven by investments in infrastructure and technical talent for AI.\n*   Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir, reportedly sold his Nvidia stock in Q3 2025 and acquired shares in Microsoft and Apple, signaling a potential shift in his AI investment strategy towards more diversified tech companies. Palantir, a company he co-founded, expects revenue between $7.18 billion and $7.20 billion in 2026, a more than 60% increase from 2025, largely due to government contracts for military-grade AI tools.\n\n**Quantum Technology**\n*   The White House is developing a landmark executive order focused on quantum information sciences and technology, aiming to establish a whole-of-government approach to bolster the US quantum ecosystem.\n*   IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) announced its acquisition of SkyWater Technology (NASDAQ: SKYT) for approximately $1.8 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. This acquisition aims to accelerate IonQ's fault-tolerant quantum computing roadmap and secure a fully scalable domestic supply chain, positioning IonQ as a quantum partner for the U.S. government.\n*   Quantum Computing Inc. (QCi) completed the acquisition of Luminar Semiconductor, Inc. (LSI) for $110 million. This move is part of QCi's strategy to build a vertically integrated photonics and quantum technology platform and is expected to enhance its ability to serve government and defense-related customers.\n*   D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) announced that Florida Atlantic University (FAU) signed a $20 million agreement to purchase and install an Advantage2\u2122 annealing quantum computer. This collaboration aims to advance quantum computing education, research, and applied innovation in Florida.\n\n**Drone Technology**\n*   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched a new office dedicated to rapidly procuring and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies. This office is finalizing a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies to secure events like America250 and the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n*   The Pentagon's \"Blue UAS\" program, which provides a list of approved drone providers for the U.S. government, has transitioned from the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).\n*   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) modified its ban on foreign-produced drones and critical drone components by exempting those already on the \"Blue List\" maintained by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), as well as components considered \"domestic end products\" under the Buy American Standard.\n*   A FY2026 funding bill includes $75 million for counter-drone and directed energy programs, a $20 million increase from the previous year.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   On February 2, 2026, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced a new categorical exclusion (CATEX) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for advanced nuclear reactors. This is effective immediately and covers authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning, aiming to streamline these processes.\n*   Congress approved the FY2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act in mid-January, providing the DOE with $49 billion, including $1.79 billion for Nuclear Energy.\n*   In January 2026, the Energy Department announced a $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic uranium enrichment and to jumpstart new supply chains for high-assay low-enriched uranium.\n*   The pre-application deadline for the FY 2026 Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research was extended to February 3, 2026.\n\n**Space Technology & Satellite Communication**\n*   Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI has merged with SpaceX. The combined company is valued at $1.25 trillion (SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion) and plans to launch a constellation of up to a million satellites to power orbital AI data centers. This strategic move aims to support xAI's high operational costs and may facilitate a SpaceX initial public offering (IPO) later in 2026.\n\n### Single-Stock 2x Leveraged ETFs: Recent Launches and Filings\n\nThe following table lists single-stock 2x leveraged ETFs that have either launched in the last 30 days (since January 5, 2026) or are filed to launch in the next 3 weeks (until February 25, 2026), focusing on U.S. markets.\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer         | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |\n| Sandisk (SNDK)    | SNXX           | 2x Long        | Tradr ETFs     | January 2026   |\n| Western Digital (WDC) | WDCX       | 2x Long        | Tradr ETFs     | January 2026   |\n| LITE              | LITX           | 2x Long        | Tradr ETFs     | January 2026   |\n| Celestica (CLS)   | CSEX           | 2x Long        | Tradr ETFs     | January 2026   |\n| Red Cat Holdings, Inc.
