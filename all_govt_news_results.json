Companies include Aegis Aerospace, Inc., Axient Corp, Cimarron Software Services, Consolidated Safety Services, JES Tech, KBR Wyle, Leidos, Metis, Oceaneering, Tec-Masters, Teledyne Brown Engineering, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n*   Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract by NASA and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in July 2023 to engineer a spacecraft equipped with a nuclear rocket engine as part of the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) initiative.\n*   The Boeing Co. was awarded a $2.8 billion contract for Evolved Strategic Satellite (ESS) communications space development and production by the Air Force, expected to be completed by December 31, 2033.\n*   NASA is expanding its Near Space Network's commercial direct-to-Earth capabilities. In December 2024, SSC Space U.S. Inc. and Viasat, Inc. received task order awards under new Near Space Network services contracts, with a cumulative maximum value of $4.82 billion, extending potentially through September 2034.\n*   The Space Force is increasing funding to build proliferated, resilient satellite systems, including nearly $900 million earmarked for procurement of satellite services and custom-built GEO satellites for 2025 and 2026.\n\n**Drone Technology:**\nThe DOD is investing in next-generation drone capabilities.\n*   DARPA announced in May 2024 the selection of six companies\u2014AeroVironment, Griffon Aerospace, Karem Aircraft, Method Aeronautics, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky\u2014for the next phase of its AdvaNced airCraft Infrastructure-Less Launch And RecoverY (ANCILLARY) program, aimed at developing a Class 3 UAS VTOL X-Plane.\n*   The U.S. Army selected Teal's drones for its Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program, making Teal a \"program of record\" supplier.\n*   Red Cat Holdings announced contract orders totaling $2.5 million from two NATO allied countries for Teal 2 drones in 2024 and secured a $1.6 million deal to supply drones to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n*   AgEagle achieved Green UAS certification from a Pentagon-supported program in December 2024, verifying its drones as secure and NDAA-compliant.\n*   Unusual Machines' Fat Shark Video Transmitter was approved by the Defense Innovation Unit for the Blue UAS Framework in July 2025, confirming cybersecurity compliance for DOD use.\n*   DroneShield is participating in Project FlyTrap, a multinational defense exercise led by the U.S. Army V Corps, aimed at advancing Counter-Uncrewed Aerial System (CUAS) capabilities among NATO allies.\n\n**Robotics:**\nWhile not exclusively robotics, many AI and drone initiatives involve advanced autonomous systems and robotic components. Elon Musk has also suggested the potential sale of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot within 2025. Defense tech startups like Scout AI are working on universal military robot control, and Foundation's Phantom MK1 Robot is also a notable development.\n\n**Nuclear Energy:**\n*   The contract awarded to Lockheed Martin by NASA and DARPA for a nuclear rocket engine spacecraft highlights a governmental push in this area.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\nThe US government is significantly increasing its AI investments for defense and operational efficiency.\n*   The Department of Defense's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) awarded individual contracts valued at up to $200 million each to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI in July 2025, to provide advanced AI capabilities for national security challenges.\n*   The Pentagon also awarded a contract to OpenAI for Government to develop AI prototypes, and Microsoft's OpenAI-enabled Azure offerings have been approved for use at the highest security classification level.\n*   The U.S. Army awarded Palantir an enterprise agreement worth as much as $10 billion in August 2025 for commercial software, including data integration, analytics, and AI services.\n*   Groq signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Energy in mid-December 2025 to explore advancing AI inference for scientific discovery and energy-efficient AI compute infrastructure. Groq also partnered with Carahsoft Technology in May 2024 for public sector distribution of its AI inference products.\n*   Federal AI spending is projected to reach over $3.3 billion in FY 2025, with the Department of Defense accounting for 72% of AI government contracts obligations from FY 2022 to 2024.\n\n**Quantum Technology:**\n*   The Trump administration has hinted at taking equity stakes in U.S. quantum computing companies, indicating a national priority for this technology due to its importance for defense competitiveness and as a strategic counterweight to China.\n*   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized new post-quantum cryptography algorithms in 2024, creating a compliance requirement for government contractors, banks, and defense companies to upgrade their systems.\n\n**Latest Innovative Technologies (General):**\n*   The Department of Commerce launched the $8 billion ProTech 2.0 contract for Professional Scientific and Technical Services, aiming to enhance weather data collection and modeling.\n*   The Department of State introduced a $5 billion Infrastructure Acquisition program (ACCESS) for IT products.\n*   The Alliant 3 contract is anticipated to offer extensive opportunities for government contractors in IT and professional services, with a $75 billion ceiling.\n*   The FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes provisions to expand a pilot program for streamlining awards for innovative technology projects and increase small business awareness of DOD contract opportunities in critical technology areas.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies & Prominent Investors:\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks refer to Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, which are significant drivers of innovation.\n\n**Nuclear Energy (Magnificent 7):**\n*   Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy in September 2024 to restart Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to provide energy for its data centers.\n*   Alphabet (Google) partnered with Kairos Power in October 2024 to purchase power from and invest in small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), aiming to develop and deploy up to 500 megawatts of SMR capacity by the early 2030s.\n*   Amazon is collaborating with Energy Northwest to develop two SMR facilities in Washington state and is partnering with Dominion Energy and Energy Northwest to secure nuclear energy for its operations.\n\n**AI (Magnificent 7):**\n*   Nvidia continues to be a leader in AI, with strong demand expected for its next-generation Blackwell chips in 2025.\n*   Microsoft is pivoting toward \"Agentic AI\" in 2026, enabling enterprises to build autonomous agents through its Copilot Studio.\n*   As mentioned above, Google, OpenAI (backed by Microsoft), and xAI (Elon Musk's company) received significant AI contracts from the DOD in 2025.\n\n**Quantum Technology (Magnificent 7):**\n*   Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, and Amazon all have billion-dollar quantum programs.\n\n**Elon Musk (Tesla, xAI, SpaceX):**\n*   Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has indicated plans to roll out full self-driving software in Texas and California in 2025 and has floated the idea of selling Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot within the year.\n*   His AI company, xAI, received a significant contract from the DOD for advanced AI capabilities and announced its 'Grok for Government' offering in July 2025.\n*   SpaceX, while not one of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" is a prominent space tech company, receiving significant valuations and being a recipient of NASA satellite communication agreements.\n\n**Sam Altman & Peter Thiel:**\nWhile Sam Altman is a co-founder of OpenAI, which has received DOD contracts and is backed by Microsoft, specific recent individual investments by Sam Altman or Peter Thiel into the listed technology sectors, outside of their company affiliations or general venture capital activities, were not explicitly detailed in the provided information.
