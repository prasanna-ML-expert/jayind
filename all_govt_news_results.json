This strategy outlines seven \"Pace-Setting Projects\" aimed at accelerating AI execution and infrastructure development, with initial demonstrations expected by July 2026. The strategy mandates that all contracted AI models must be deployable within 30 days of public release and be usable for \"all lawful purposes.\" This standard applies to companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and xAI, which received contracts of up to $200 million each in July 2025.\n*   A dispute has arisen with Anthropic, whose Claude model is currently deployed on classified military networks, over its refusal to permit mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n*   The U.S. Army is incorporating AI tools to assist in writing doctrine, including for idea generation, grammar, and readability.\n*   The DOD's total IT budget request for fiscal year 2026 is $66 billion, marking an increase of $1.8 billion from 2025, with a notable increase in AI investment.\n\n**Robotics**\n*   The Trump administration is considering a new executive order on robotics in 2026 to foster a more favorable regulatory environment for robotics development and deployment, particularly prioritizing American-made technologies and advanced manufacturing.\n*   The Commerce Department is actively engaging with robotics industry CEOs, and the Department of Transportation is reportedly preparing a robotics-working group.\n*   Bipartisan House lawmakers have introduced legislation to establish an independent, temporary commission focused on robotics and related applications to inform future policy.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   In January 2026, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $2.7 billion investment to bolster domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, supporting President Trump's objective of expanding U.S. nuclear energy capacity.\n*   The DOE also launched President Trump's Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program, selecting 11 advanced reactor projects with the ambitious goal of achieving criticality for at least three test reactors by July 4, 2026.\n*   Previously, in December 2025, the DOE awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec for the advancement of U.S. small modular reactors, and in November 2025, it provided a $1 billion loan to Constellation to help finance the restart of a nuclear power plant.\n\n**Space Tech & Satellite Communication**\n*   NASA issued an open call for industry feedback on January 12, 2026, regarding technology shortfalls that impede long-term deep space habitation, particularly for the Artemis program and future Mars missions. The deadline for input was February 20, 2026.\n*   NASA's Artemis II mission, a crewed flight test of the Orion spacecraft around the Moon, is scheduled to launch by April 2026.\n*   The NASA SpaceX Crew-12 mission launched in February 2026 for a science expedition to the International Space Station.\n*   The U.S. Space Force (USSF) Commercial Satellite Communications Office (CSCO) released a forecast on January 15, 2026, detailing anticipated requirements for satellite communication capabilities for fiscal year 2026.\n*   Raytheon Co. secured a $22.8 million contract on February 18, 2026, for comprehensive maintenance and support services for SMART-T satellite communications systems.\n*   MTN Satellite Communications announced an agreement with SpaceX on February 18, 2026, to become an authorized provider of SpaceX's government-specific satellite connectivity ecosystem, designed for defense, government, and energy sector clients.\n\n**Drone Tech**\n*   The Department of Transportation (DOT) has reopened a drone-related Request for Information (RFI) amid plans for a new FAA office.\n\n### Investments and Developments by Prominent Companies and Figures\n\n**Elon Musk**\n*   In February 2026, SpaceX acquired xAI, an artificial intelligence startup, in an all-stock transaction that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion.\n*   SpaceX is anticipated to conduct an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2026, with some reports suggesting a potential June timeline, aiming for a valuation exceeding $1 trillion. Funds from the IPO are expected to support AI integration projects and the construction of space-based data centers.\n*   Musk has predicted that Tesla's robotaxi service will be \"very, very widespread\" across the U.S. by the end of 2026.\n*   Musk's personal wealth is primarily concentrated in his stakes in Tesla (approximately 13%) and SpaceX (approximately 42%). He also holds investments in Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.\n\n**Sam Altman**\n*   OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, is reportedly seeking up to $50 billion in funding from Middle East investors, potentially valuing the company at $830 billion.\n*   On February 7, 2026, OpenAI and Sam Altman personally invested in Merge Labs, a new startup focused on developing next-generation, non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI), positioning itself as a direct competitor to Neuralink.\n*   Altman has outlined plans for a $1 trillion investment in datacenters and has secured multibillion-dollar deals with several chipmakers.\n*   OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a potential IPO towards the end of 2026, with a valuation that could reach $1 trillion.\n*   Altman has expressed his belief that 2026 will be a significant year for scientific progress driven by advancements in AI.\n\n**Peter Thiel**\n*   Thiel Macro, Peter Thiel's hedge fund, significantly reduced its holdings in Tesla by 76% during the third quarter of 2025, citing concerns over the company's valuation.
