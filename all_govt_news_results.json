The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes a proposal to establish a government-owned innovation hub and production facility to produce up to one million small unmanned aircraft systems under the oversight of the U.S. Army Materiel Command. The Trump administration has implemented policies such as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" to unlock federal funding for domestic drone production, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's directive, \"Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance,\" aims to facilitate sales for American drone companies to the military. The U.S. Department of Defense is also exploring the development of uncrewed vehicles utilizing artificial intelligence through its Replicator initiative.\n\n**Robotics**\nThe White House's AI Action Plan includes calls for investment in AI, robotics, and drone manufacturing. The policy landscape for 2025-2026 appears increasingly favorable for robotics, automation, and AI adoption across U.S. industries, partly due to initiatives like the Biden administration's AI Executive Order (issued in December 2024) encouraging broad AI adoption across government.\n\n**Space Technology**\nFor fiscal year 2026, NASA is authorized to appropriate $920.5 million for Space Technology. NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) released an Umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled \"Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion-2026 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2026)\" around December 9, 2025. This solicitation is expected to be open for one year and aims to advance U.S. space technology innovation and competitiveness. Another similar multiple-award contract, Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion \u2013 2025, had a solicitation released around June 3, 2025.\n\n**Satellite Communication**\nThe United States Space Force (USSF) Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Office (CSCO) published a forecast to industry on January 29, 2026, outlining future requirements for Fiscal Year 2026 related to satellite telecommunications. A Virtual Industry Day was held on June 10, 2025, for the Commercial and Military Satellite Communications Operations Support (COSMOS) acquisition, which is the follow-on contract to the Wideband Satellite Communication Operation and Technical Support II (WSOTS II) contract, set to end on January 31, 2027. In April 2025, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. received a $14.9 million modification for the Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications Rapid Prototyping Special Study #6, with work expected to be completed by July 2025. L3Harris Technologies Communication Systems \u2013 West was awarded a $10.9 million modification in April 2025 to develop, test, manufacture, deliver, manage, and support the AN/SRQ-4 Radio Terminal Set Common Data Link Hawklink, with work anticipated to be completed by April 2026. The Space Force also awarded a $4 billion secure communications contract for the Protected Tactical Satellite Communications-Global program to five providers: Astranis Space Technologies, Boeing, Intelsat General (acquired by SES), Northrop Grumman, and Viasat, announced on July 29, 2025.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\nIn January 2026, the DOE announced a $2.7 billion investment to bolster domestic uranium enrichment, awarding $900 million in contracts to three companies for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) services over the next decade. In December 2025, the DOE provided $800 million to TVA and Holtec to accelerate the deployment of U.S. small modular reactors. A $1 billion loan was announced in November 2025 to Constellation for the Crane Clean Energy Center Restart project. The U.S. government established a strategic partnership with Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management in October 2025 to advance Westinghouse's nuclear reactor technologies. Additionally, in September 2025, the DOE selected four companies for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects to strengthen domestic nuclear fuel supply chains. On February 2, 2026, the DOE introduced a new categorical exclusion (CATEX) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning of advanced nuclear reactors, effective immediately, with a public comment period until March 4, 2026.
