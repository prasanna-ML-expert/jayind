    "news": "Here's a compilation of announcements, news, contracts, projects, and rumors related to quantum tech, drone tech, robotics, space tech, satellite communication, nuclear energy, and AI from USA government entities, prominent companies, and investors, primarily from late 2024 and throughout 2025:\n\n## USA Government, DOD Defense, DOE, NASA, or Similar Organizations\n\n### Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n*   The Biden administration's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request prioritizes AI and tech research, allocating millions across more than a dozen federal agencies for AI implementation. It also proposes $3 billion to responsibly develop, test, procure, and integrate transformative AI applications across the federal government.\n*   In January 2025, President Biden signed an executive order on \"Advancing United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure.\" This order directs the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Energy (DOE) to each identify and lease at least three federal sites to private-sector entities by the end of 2027 for the construction and operation of \"frontier AI data centers\" and clean energy facilities to power them. They were also directed to launch competitive public solicitations by March 31, 2025.\n*   Federal AI spending is projected to exceed $3.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2025. The Department of Defense alone accounts for 72% of all AI government contract obligations, totaling $4.0 billion from FY 2022 to 2024.\n*   America's AI Action Plan, released by the White House in July 2025, emphasizes prioritizing investment in AI, robotics, and related technologies for manufacturing and logistics, including applications for defense and national security.\n\n### Quantum Technology\n*   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) in July 2024. This initiative aims to identify and verify approaches for building fault-tolerant quantum computers that can achieve utility-scale operation (where computational value exceeds cost) by 2033.\n*   In April 2025, DARPA selected nearly 20 companies to participate in Stage A of the QBI. These companies, including Google Quantum AI, Microsoft, PsiQuantum, Alice & Bob, Atlantic Quantum, Atom Computing, Diraq, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, will provide detailed technical concepts over six months.\n*   IBM announced in November 2025 that it had been selected for Stage B of DARPA's QBI, moving from conceptual review to rigorous technical validation of utility-scale quantum architectures.\n*   Government investment in quantum technology reached $10 billion globally by April 2025. The National Quantum Initiative in the United States is also being reauthorized with substantially increased funding.\n\n### Robotics & Drone Technology\n*   The Biden administration's America's AI Action Plan (July 2025) underscores the federal government's intent to prioritize investment in robotics and related technologies for manufacturing and logistics, including defense applications.\n\n### Space Technology & Satellite Communication\n*   In May 2024, NASA awarded $6 billion in spacecraft contracts to four companies: ARGOTEC Inc., Blue Canyon Technologies LLC, General Atomics, and Kongsberg NanoAvionics US LLC. These contracts are for providing spacecraft and related services for the Goddard Space Flight Center and run through August 31, 2025, with potential extensions to August 31, 2030.\n*   NASA launched a new research vehicle, Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion \u2013 2025 (SpaceTech REDDI 2025), with a solicitation expected in June 2025. The agency plans a maximum of 300 small research awards, ranging from $84,000 to $2 million, to promote innovative space technologies.\n*   The U.S. Space Force is preparing for a major overhaul of its military-grade satellite communications (SATCOM) architecture, with several contract awards expected early in 2025.\n*   Projections from the U.S. Space Force's Commercial Satellite Communications Office (CSCO) indicated approximately $1.7 billion in commercial satcom contracts could be awarded over 12 months from May 2024, including a potential $880-890 million contract for global satcom services for senior government aircraft.\n*   In March 2025, the Space Force began taking over management responsibility for contracting commercial SATCOM bandwidth and services from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), with an associated $13 billion funding pool for internet services from low Earth orbit constellations.\n*   Space Systems Command (SSC) awarded a Protected Tactical Satellite Communications \u2013 Global (PTS-G) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and initial orders totaling $37.5 million in July 2025. The awardees include Viasat, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Astranis Space Technologies Corp, Intelsat General Communications LLC, and The Boeing Company.\n*   The Space Force expects to award $905 million in contracts over the next five years through a new Maneuverable GEO program, aiming to form a commercial fleet of communication satellites that can shift in geosynchronous orbit. A contract award is anticipated by June 2026.\n\n### Nuclear Energy\n*   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research (CINR) funding opportunity, with an overall budget of approximately $60 million for university-led research and development projects. Applications for Scientific Infrastructure Support for Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research for FY2025 were due in July 2024.\n*   The DOE reissued a $900 million solicitation in March 2025 for small modular nuclear reactors (Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Pathway to Deployment), utilizing funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\n\n## Magnificent 7 Companies, Prominent Investors, or Industry Figures\n\n### Elon Musk (Neuralink)\n*   Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-tech company, has continued its progress in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
