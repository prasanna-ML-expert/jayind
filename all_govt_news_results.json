This builds on IonQ's momentum in quantum networking and includes an extension of its contract with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a $9 million deal with the University of Maryland.\n    *   Quantum Computing Inc. (QCi) was awarded a subcontract of up to $406,478 to support NASA's Langley Research Center in developing quantum-based techniques for removing solar noise from space-based LIDAR data.\n    *   QCi also secured a contract from NIST for the design and fabrication of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits.\n    *   Rigetti Computing, Inc. (RGTI) was awarded a three-year, $5.8 million contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory to advance superconducting quantum networking in collaboration with QphoX.\n    *   The U.S. Department of Energy announced $625 million in funding to renew its five National Quantum Information Science Research Centers.\n\n*   **Robotics:**\n    *   Motiv Space Systems and PickNik Robotics announced a contractual agreement on February 11, 2026, to collaborate on critical software development for NASA's upcoming Fly Foundational Robotics (FFR) mission. This mission aims to advance on-orbit manipulation capabilities for In-space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) initiatives.\n    *   NASA's Intelligent Robotics Group is actively engaged in projects such as the Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking (ISAAC), utilizing Astrobee free-flying robots and the Robonaut 2 humanoid robot on the International Space Station. They are also developing onboard software, navigation systems, and rover robot-driving tools for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission.\n\n*   **Drone Technology:**\n    *   The U.S. Navy is seeking long-range strike drones capable of launching from destroyers and other warships without large flight decks, as indicated by a Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) solicitation with a deadline of February 27, 2026.\n    *   A cybersecurity project from Northern Arizona University, funded by the Army Research Lab and Air Force Research Lab, is developing new technology to create resilient drone networks capable of ignoring signal jamming.\n    *   The U.S. military plans to prioritize small, low-cost drones, with the Pentagon showcasing several American-made prototypes in June 2025.\n    *   The military has signed a contract to integrate Shield AI's Hivemind platform into uncrewed systems to enhance autonomous operations, particularly in environments where GPS and communications are jammed.\n\n*   **Space Technology & Satellite Communication:**\n    *   Starfish Space secured a $54.5 million contract from the Space Force for a second Otter satellite-servicing craft, funded by the Accelerate the Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies (APFIT) program. Starfish Space also won a $52.5 million Space Development Agency contract for disposing of dead Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) satellites.\n    *   The Space Force's Space Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC) is undertaking \"Project Hecate,\" a study to create a multi-orbit network of space-based capabilities for Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) data beyond 2040. The study is expected to conclude in the fall of 2026.\n    *   ThinKom Solutions has been awarded a military contract to provide portable satellite communications ground stations.\n    *   Integrate, a software startup, closed a $17 million Series A funding round on February 11, 2026, following a $25 million SBIR Phase 3 contract from the U.S. Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC) in June 2025 for its classified collaboration software.\n    *   United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Vulcan Centaur rocket successfully launched the U.S. Space Force's USSF-87 mission, carrying two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites and research and development payloads, on February 12, 2026.\n\n*   **Other Innovative Technologies:**\n    *   The Colorado Energy Office (CEO) announced $5.2 million in Clean Air Program (CAP) grant awards on February 12, 2026, for industrial emissions reduction technology providers.

Google Search results primarily highlight news *about* filings or launches, often for a broader range of leveraged ETFs or older announcements, rather than a structured database of *single-stock* 2x leveraged ETFs with precise launch/effective dates directly from recent SEC filings. Retrieving this specific, highly dynamic market data would require a specialized financial data terminal or direct, continuous monitoring and parsing of SEC EDGAR feeds, which is beyond the scope of a standard web search."
