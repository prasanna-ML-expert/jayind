These contracts, named CRUISE and QUEST, are part of the Transition of Quantum Sensing (TQS) program aimed at accelerating the adoption of quantum sensors for alternative position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) applications.\n*   **IonQ** plans to invest $1.8 billion in **SkyWater Technology** to advance U.S. quantum computing capabilities, focusing on developing and scaling production for aerospace and defense customers. This move, announced in January 2026, aims to integrate semiconductor foundry capabilities with IonQ's full-stack quantum platform.\n*   **D-Wave Quantum** established a U.S. government business unit in December 2025 to promote the adoption of quantum computing for national security and defense applications. In January 2026, D-Wave, along with Anduril and Davidson Technologies, highlighted the application of quantum computing for missile defense optimization, claiming 10x faster intercept calculations in simulations.\n*   The U.S. defense cyber budget, as of January 2026, is allocating funds to address quantum threats.\n*   The White House Office of Technology Policy, National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DOE) announced over $1 billion in awards for Artificial Intelligence Institutes and Quantum Information Science Research Centers.\n*   The **Department of Defense (DoD)** is looking to speed up the deployment of new GPS alternatives, including quantum technologies, as reported in November 2025.\n*   **DARPA** is actively working to integrate future quantum technologies into existing networks and has selected 15 companies to outline their quantum approaches as of April and August 2025. New legislation has been proposed to boost U.S. DoD Quantum Capabilities, suggesting a quantum advisor role, a center of excellence within the Defense Department, and increased funding for quantum information sciences.\n\n**Drone Technology**\n*   The **Pentagon** broadened its counter-drone authorities in January 2026 to enhance the protection of U.S. military facilities against drone threats, following increased sightings of unmanned aerial systems over key Defense Department assets.\n*   In June 2025, the **White House** issued a directive establishing a Federal Task Force to review regulations and recommend new strategies for countering malicious drone operations within U.S. airspace.\n*   **L3Harris Technologies** secured a contract from the U.S. Department of Defense in June 2025 for additional Vehicle Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment (VAMPIRE) portable counter-drone systems.\n\n**Robotics**\n*   The **DoD's Army Contracting Command** issued an $80 million federal funding opportunity in November 2025 to establish a \"Robots in Manufacturing Environments Manufacturing Innovation Institute\" (RIME-MII). The institute aims to boost U.S. competitiveness in robotics applied to manufacturing, focusing on human-robot collaboration, perception, control, autonomy, mobility, and dexterous manipulation.\n*   The **U.S. Army** is testing new robotic \"tank killer\" swarm vehicles. During the xTechOverwatch for Unmanned Systems event in November 2025, they evaluated autonomous robotic systems like the FireAnt UGV by Swarmbotics AI, selecting 20 teams for future development.\n*   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** selected 14 robotics and automation projects in December 2025 to integrate intelligent systems into laboratory workflows, aiming for faster experiments with less manual intervention.\n*   The **U.S. Army** experimented with fully autonomous Small Multipurpose Equipment Transports (S-METs) in August 2024 as part of a broader DOD initiative, equipping some with weapon stations and others with tethered unmanned aerial systems for reconnaissance.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   The **Department of Energy (DOE)** announced new energy/AI infrastructure projects at its sites in December 2025, including initiatives related to developing nuclear reactors on federal lands as part of new executive orders.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   The **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)** announced over $320 million in investments in December 2025 to accelerate AI tools for scientific research under the \"Genesis Mission.\" This funding supports initiatives like the American Science Cloud ($40 million) and the Transformational AI Models Consortium ($30 million).\n*   The **DOE** officially launched the \"Genesis Mission\" in November 2025, a coordinated national effort to advance AI-accelerated innovation and discovery across scientific domains, national security, and energy.\n*   In December 2025, the **DOE** announced collaboration agreements with 24 organizations to further the Genesis Mission and launched an AI-driven biotechnology platform at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).\n*   The **DOE** also partnered with **NVIDIA** and **Oracle** in October 2025 to build the largest DOE AI supercomputer.\n*   The **U.S. Army** awarded **Salesforce** a $5.6 billion contract in January 2026 to enhance its data analytics capabilities and prepare for future agentic AI deployments, contributing to military modernization.\n*   The **Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)** issued a solicitation for a $10 billion multiple-award contract in January 2026 to fund science and technology research across air, space, and cyber domains, which would include AI-related advancements.\n\n**Space Technology & Satellite Communication**\n*   Beyond the general aerospace and defense focus for quantum technologies with IonQ, specific recent U.S. government announcements or contracts focused on *space tech partnerships* or *satellite communication contracts* with private companies were not distinctly identified in the provided search results within the specified timeframe.\n\n**Latest Innovative Technologies**\n*   **Raytheon** was awarded a $1,025,100,000 modification to a contract for Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor production in January 2026.\n\n### Investments by \"Magnificent 7\" Companies or Prominent Investors\n\nThe recent search results provided information on leveraged ETFs for some \"Magnificent 7\" companies but did not detail specific venture capital investments or acquisitions by these companies or prominent investors like Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, or Elon Musk into the listed sectors within the last 30 days.\n\n### Single-Stock 2x Leveraged ETFs (U.S. Markets)\n\nHere is a table of single-stock 2x leveraged ETFs that have either launched in the last 30 days (since December 31, 2025) or are filed to launch in the next 3 weeks (until February 20, 2026), based on available information up to January 30, 2026:\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----- | :-------------------- |\n| Lumentum Holdings Inc.
