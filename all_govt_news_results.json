This contract, awarded on March 13, 2025, provides for design space for Air Force Research Laboratory-based quantum circuits, software for basic component construction, and chip delivery, with work expected to be completed by May 13, 2027. Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative approaches for its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) in 2026, aiming to develop utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers and computational workflows.\n*   **Department of Energy (DoE) Nuclear Energy & AI:**\n    *   The DoE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in December 2025 for Fiscal Year 2026 Scientific Infrastructure Support for Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research, with $5.0 million in funding available across an expected 15 grants. The overall goal is to advance nuclear energy science and technology, support research infrastructure, and address challenges in the sector. Applications for this funding are due by April 9, 2026, with awards anticipated to begin on February 1, 2027.\n    *   The DoE is also actively supporting AI research infrastructure, with NVIDIA joining the Genesis Mission as a private industry partner in February 2026. Furthermore, NVIDIA and the U.S. Department of Energy partnered to build seven new AI supercomputers to enhance research capabilities in energy, science, and national security, announced in October 2025.\n*   **NASA Space Tech:**\n    *   In January 2025, NASA selected 15 innovative ideas for its NIAC (NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts) program, awarding a combined maximum of $2.625 million in grants for Phase I studies. These concepts aim to transform future missions, including developing small robots for exploring oceans on other worlds and growing space habitats from fungi.\n    *   NASA also plans to offer up to 300 small research awards, ranging from $84,000 to $2 million, under its SpaceTech REDDI 2025 vehicle. This initiative, with a solicitation expected in June 2025, focuses on nearly 200 technology needs, including sensors, autonomous systems, and advanced manufacturing.\n    *   NASA selected five firms for Civilian Commercialization Readiness Pilot Program (CCRPP) awards in 2025, totaling $11.3 million, to accelerate technology commercialization and transition to NASA missions.\n    *   The 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge took place in October 2025, where participants worked on transforming NASA's open data into actionable tools.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies & Prominent Investor Activities:\n\n*   **Amazon (Drone Tech/AI):**\n    *   Amazon formally expanded its Prime Air drone delivery program to serve 10 major U.S. cities as of February 21, 2025, shipping packages up to five pounds in under 30 minutes using AI-driven by AWS. Targeted cities include Dallas and Atlanta.\n    *   The expansion follows FAA approval in May 2024 for drone operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS).\n    *   Amazon also received FAA approval to deliver lithium-ion battery products via drones in Arizona and Texas.\n    *   Further expansion plans include San Antonio by late 2025 and early planning for Kansas City, Missouri.\n    *   However, Amazon decided to halt its commercial drone delivery plans in Italy due to the broader business regulatory framework in the country not supporting its long-term objectives, as announced in December 2025.\n*   **Meta (AI):**\n    *   Meta Platforms expects its annual capital spending to increase sharply in 2026, reaching between $115 billion and $135 billion, up from approximately $72.22 billion in the previous year, primarily due to heavy investments in AI infrastructure. The company is building multiple large-scale data centers across the U.S. to support AI developments.\n    *   In 2025, Meta invested over $10 billion in AI infrastructure, with projected capital spending for the year between $60 billion and $65 billion to fuel generative AI ambitions and bolster core services.\n    *   Meta entered into a joint venture with Blue Owl Capital in October 2025 to own the Hyperion AI data center campus in Louisiana.\n    *   In 2025, Meta also signed contracts with Alphabet, CoreWeave, and Nebius for additional compute power.\n*   **Microsoft (Quantum Tech):**\n    *   Microsoft launched the 2026 Quantum Research Pioneers Program (QuPP) in January 2026, investing $200,000 per project to accelerate the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. The program focuses on topological and measurement-based quantum computing. Proposals were accepted until January 31, 2026, with decisions expected on March 15, 2026.\n    *   In February 2025, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in quantum computing, developing a new quantum processor based on a novel state of matter, which they believe will enable meaningful quantum computers in \"years, not decades.\" Microsoft was also selected by DARPA to build a prototype fault-tolerant quantum computer based on these innovations.\n    *   In December 2024, Microsoft announced a breakthrough achieving the largest logical entangled state with 24 logical qubits from 80 physical qubits, in partnership with Atom Computing. They intend to start shipping powerful quantum computing machines based on this technology in 2025.\n*   **NVIDIA (AI):**\n    *   NVIDIA made a significant $10 billion strategic investment in Anthropic, an AI safety company, in February 2026. This partnership involves Anthropic training and running inference on NVIDIA's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems, covering model development, infrastructure deployment, and long-term compute contracts.\n    *   NVIDIA also announced several new strategic partnerships in February 2026, including with Groq (AI inference), Eli Lilly (drug discovery AI lab), Siemens (industrial AI operating system), and Synopsys (engineering and design).\n    *   In February 2026, NVIDIA announced a multi-year, multi-generation AI infrastructure partnership with Meta, involving millions of NVIDIA Blackwell and Rubin GPUs.\n    *   NVIDIA and OpenAI announced a strategic partnership in September 2025 to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure by 2026, with NVIDIA investing up to $100 billion. The first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems is targeted for deployment in the second half of 2026 using the NVIDIA Vera Rubin platform.\n*   **Tesla (Robotics/AI):**\n    *   Tesla is heavily focusing on its Optimus humanoid robot program, with Elon Musk stating in September 2025 that humanoid robots like Optimus might make up 80% of Tesla's value.\n    *   Tesla aims for several thousand Optimus units in 2025, targeting 50,000 to 100,000 units in 2026, and potentially 500,000 to 1 million units annually by the decade's end.\n    *   Pilot production of Optimus Gen 3 is expected by late 2025, with a \"completely different\" scalable production line coming online in 2026. Tesla's AI teams are bracing for a \"hardest year\" in 2026 as the company races to deliver its autonomous future.\n\n### Other Noteworthy Mentions:\n\n*   **Uber (Drone Tech):** In September 2025, Uber announced a partnership with Flytrex, a drone delivery company, to pilot drone deliveries for Uber Eats in several U.S. locations by the end of 2025.\n\n### Single-Stock 2x Leveraged ETFs (Launched in last 30 days or filed to launch in next 3 weeks):\n\nBased on recent announcements (January 28, 2026, to February 27, 2026, and upcoming filings), here's a table of relevant 2x leveraged single-stock ETFs:\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer                  | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- |\n| ASML Holding (ASML)    | DDAS          | 2x             | Direxion                | February 11, 2026   |\n| Alibaba Group (BABA)   | DBAB          | 2x             | Direxion                | February 11, 2026   |\n| Marvell Technology, Inc.
