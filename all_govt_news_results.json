These contracts aim to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI capabilities across military and government operations, focusing on national security challenges. The Pentagon is already implementing generative AI tools for various platforms, including large language model services for the Joint Staff and Combatant Commands.\n*   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced over $320 million in new investments in December 2025 to advance AI tools for scientific research as part of its \"Genesis Mission.\" This initiative aims to integrate AI with the nation's scientific infrastructure and includes 14 robotics and automation projects, as well as 37 foundational AI awards for data curation and modeling. The DOE also signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with 24 organizations, including OpenAI and NVIDIA, to collaborate on the Genesis Mission. NVIDIA's collaboration with the DOE specifically covers open AI science models, robotics, \"autonomous labs,\" nuclear fission and fusion, and quantum computing research.\n\n**Quantum Technology**\n*   Microsoft has announced plans to establish a quantum center in Maryland and initiated its \"Quantum Ready Initiative\" to assist enterprises in identifying quantum computing use cases and deployment readiness.\n*   IonQ, in partnership with the University of Maryland and the State of Maryland, unveiled a $1 billion investment to establish the \"Capital of Quantum,\" with IonQ serving as a key partner in securing federal government contracts. IonQ has also formed a federal unit dedicated to U.S. government applications.\n*   Rigetti secured two orders for quantum computing systems totaling $5.7 million and announced a $5.8 million contract with QphoX from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).\n\n**Space Tech & Satellite Communication**\n*   NASA selected four commercial companies\u2014Intuitive Machines, Kongsberg Satellite Services, SSC Space U.S., and Viasat\u2014for Near Space Network Services contracts. These contracts, with a potential cumulative value of $4.82 billion, are designed to expand the network's commercial direct-to-Earth capabilities for upcoming NASA missions, covering services from low Earth orbit out to two million kilometers from Earth. Viasat will provide global ground segment support services, while Intuitive Machines will support NASA's Lunar Exploration Ground Segment.\n*   In April 2022, NASA also awarded $278.5 million to six American satellite communications (SATCOM) firms (including SpaceX, Amazon's Kuiper Government Solutions, Viasat, Telesat U.S. Services, SES Government Solutions, and Inmarsat Government Inc.) for its Communications Services Project (CSP). This project aims for a five-year research and demonstration period, with the goal of transitioning NASA's near-Earth satellite fleet to commercial SATCOM networks by 2030.\n\n**Robotics**\n*   As part of the DOE's Genesis Mission, 14 robotics and automation projects have been selected to integrate intelligent systems into laboratory workflows for expedited and less manual experimentation.\n\n### By Magnificent 7 Companies\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   All of the \"Magnificent 7\" companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta) have announced developments in AI.\n*   **Microsoft** announced a significant breakthrough in quantum computing in February 2025 with its new Majorana 1 chip, which uses topological qubits designed to be scalable to 1 million qubits on a single chip, aiming for a fault-tolerant, scalable quantum computer within years.\n*   **Meta** acquired the Singapore-based AI startup Manus for over $2 billion in December 2025. Manus specializes in general-purpose AI agents with an annual revenue run rate exceeding $125 million. Meta also made a multibillion-dollar investment in AI startup Scale AI in June 2025, potentially exceeding $10 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has indicated that AI is Meta's primary investment focus, pursuing \"superintelligence\" and planning to expand Manus's services to more businesses.\n*   **Alphabet (Google)** was awarded a DoD contract for AI capabilities in July 2025. Google also introduced its latest quantum computing chip, Willow, in December. In December 2025, Alphabet announced it would begin selling its internally developed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for AI model training and inferencing, which boosted its stock price.\n*   **Apple** introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" in June 2024, a generative AI system deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, available for free on supported devices. This system leverages on-device and server processing with \"Private Cloud Compute\" to ensure user privacy. Apple is also reportedly developing new AI devices, including robots, a smart speaker with a display, and home-security cameras, with a tabletop robot potentially launching in 2027. A significant upgrade to Siri is anticipated for 2026.\n*   **Nvidia** continues to be a leader in AI chip development. The company saw a surge in data center GPU sales in 2025 due to contracts with OpenAI, cloud providers, and enterprises investing in large language models.\n*   **Amazon** is integrating AI tools into its Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings. The company is also making substantial investments in AI infrastructure, with $125 billion in AI capital expenditures in 2025 for data centers in Indiana and North Carolina.\n*   **Tesla** is exploring methods to incorporate AI into its product lines.\n\n**Drone Technology**\n*   **Alphabet's** \"Wing\" project is actively involved in drone delivery, having completed over 400,000 deliveries in the US, Europe, and Australia, with partnerships including Walmart and DoorDash. Wing aims to establish drone delivery as a core component of logistics infrastructure by 2035.\n*   **Amazon** is deploying its own fleet of delivery drones through Amazon Prime Air.\n\n**Robotics**\n*   **Apple** is reportedly planning a push into robotics, with new AI devices including a tabletop robot potentially launching around 2027.\n*   **Amazon** is engaged in various robotics projects.\n\n**Space Tech & Satellite Communication**\n*   **Amazon's** Kuiper Government Solutions received a $67 million contract from NASA in April 2022 for its optical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) data relay network as part of the Communications Services Project.\n\n### By Prominent Investors and Industry Figures\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   **Elon Musk's** company **xAI** was awarded a DoD contract in July 2025, with a $200 million ceiling, for AI capabilities. xAI also introduced its 'Grok for Government' offering.\n*   **OpenAI**, led by **Sam Altman**, received a DoD contract for AI capabilities in July 2025. OpenAI also signed an MOU with the DOE to explore collaboration on the Genesis Mission.\n\n**Drone Technology & Robotics**\n*   **Peter Thiel**'s Founders Fund backed **Anduril**, a US defense startup that develops drones and autonomous weapons systems.
