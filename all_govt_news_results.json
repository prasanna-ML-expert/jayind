This guidance is a response to Executive Order 14306, issued on June 6, 2025, which aimed to strengthen the nation's cybersecurity. Additionally, the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed on December 18, 2025, includes provisions for reviewing outbound investments in quantum technologies. In November 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) committed $625 million to advance quantum information science, underscoring the field's importance for technological innovation and national security. [cite: 30, first search result in previous turn]\n\n**Drone Technology**\nThe Pentagon's vetted drone program transitioned to a new agency, Unmanned Systems-Experimental (US-X), in January 2026, aiming to accelerate faster and risk-informed government oversight for the growing unmanned systems market. On January 8, 2026, the U.S. military conducted its first kinetic drone swarm exercise on American soil. The Department of the Navy also issued a \"Drone Dominance Program Phase I - Request for Solutions,\" published on December 17, 2025, with offers due by January 9, 2026.\n\n**Robotics**\nWhile no direct U.S. government contracts for robotics companies were identified within the specified timeframe, the discussion around Tesla's recent earnings mentions developments in self-driving cars and robotics. There's also speculation about space exploration companies like Intuitive Machines potentially expanding into robotics and AI for future lunar bases.\n\n**Space Technology & Satellite Communication**\nNASA announced in January 2026 the selection of industry proposals for its Habitable Worlds Observatory concept, an initiative to directly image Earth-like exoplanets. Also in January 2026, NASA awarded ADNET Systems, Inc. a contract for global modeling and data assimilation support. Comtech Telecommunications Corp. secured a follow-on contract exceeding $5 million on January 20, 2026, to supply advanced electronic components and engineering services for a significant civil space exploration program.\n\nThe U.S. Space Force is slated to receive $26 billion in defense funding for 2026, which will support strategic initiatives including the \"Golden Dome\" missile defense project. The Space Development Agency (SDA) awarded a $52 million contract to Starfish Space on January 21, 2026, for deorbiting satellites, a move aimed at mitigating space debris. The Space Force also plans to award initial contracts in February 2026 for a new fleet of reconnaissance satellites. In satellite communication, an arms sales notification published on January 27, 2026, indicated Ukraine's request for an extension of satellite communications services for its Starlink terminals.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) announced a $2.7 billion investment in January 2026 to enhance domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, supporting the expansion of U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and advanced high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) supply chains. This includes awarding $900 million each to American Centrifuge Operating, Orano Federal Services, and Peter Thiel-backed General Matter for advanced enrichment technology development. In December 2025, the DOE awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec to advance the deployment of U.S. small modular reactors. Terrestrial Energy signed an agreement with the DOE in January 2026 for Project Tefla, a pilot facility to demonstrate Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) fuel salt production.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\nThe 2026 NDAA includes AI among the critical technologies subject to outbound investment review. On January 21, 2026, the Navy awarded a contract for $24.8 million to develop and demonstrate edge-deployed modeling and simulation tools, combined with AI and machine learning, for real-time decision-making in intelligent autonomous systems. Slingshot Aerospace also secured a $27 million contract to integrate its AI technology into U.S. Space Force training programs.\n\n## Investments by Prominent Figures and Companies\n\n**Sam Altman (OpenAI)**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy, including plans for a $1 trillion investment in data centers and securing multibillion-dollar deals with chipmakers. OpenAI is reportedly seeking to raise at least $50 billion from Middle East investors. NVIDIA plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. Altman previously served as chairman of the board for nuclear energy startup Oklo, and his departure in April 2025 opened possibilities for future partnerships with OpenAI. He also invested $180 million in Retro Biosciences, a longevity startup. OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) by the end of 2026, with a valuation possibly reaching $1 trillion.\n\n**Peter Thiel**\nPeter Thiel's hedge fund, Thiel Macro, made notable portfolio adjustments in late 2025/early 2026. It sold its entire stake in Nvidia and 76% of its Tesla holdings, subsequently opening positions in Microsoft and Apple. [cite: 8, 20, 25, first search result in previous turn] In the nuclear energy sector, General Matter, a company backed by Peter Thiel, received $900 million from the DOE in January 2026 for advanced uranium enrichment technology development. Additionally, Peter Thiel-backed Bitpanda is reportedly planning an IPO in the first half of 2026. [cite: 28, first search result in previous turn]\n\n**Elon Musk**\nElon Musk's investments remain highly concentrated in his ventures, notably Tesla and SpaceX. [cite: 13, first search result in previous turn] Tesla is continuing developments in self-driving cars (FSD) and robotics. SpaceX is tapping major Wall Street banks for a potential mega-listing IPO in 2026, with market estimates valuing it at over $1 trillion. [cite: 18, 21, first search result in previous turn] Musk has also stated that Tesla and SpaceX are independently working to build up to 100 gigawatts per year of solar manufacturing capacity in the U.S. this decade to address energy needs, particularly for AI.\n\n**Magnificent 7 Companies**\n*   **Meta Platforms:** On January 9, 2026, Meta announced agreements to procure up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear energy from Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo by 2035. This includes extending the life of existing plants, funding development of next-generation Natrium reactors with TerraPower, and prepaying Oklo for power from a new Aurora powerhouse. Meta has committed approximately $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure investment through 2028, with about 75% targeting AI infrastructure.\n*   **Nvidia:** Beyond its existing dominance in AI chips, Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI.
