These companies will provide spacecraft and related services for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with contracts running through August 2025 and potential extensions.\n*   **NASA** has entered into unfunded Space Act Agreements with seven U.S. companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Space, ThinkOrbital, Vast Space, and Special Aerospace Services) under the Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities-2 (CCSC-2) initiative. These partnerships aim to advance commercial space capabilities and support the growth of a robust low Earth orbit economy.\n    *   **SpaceX** (an Elon Musk company) is collaborating with NASA on an integrated low Earth orbit architecture, which includes the potential for its Starship to function as an in-space destination.\n    *   **Blue Origin** is working with NASA to develop integrated commercial space transportation capabilities.\n    *   **Northrop Grumman** is developing a \"Persistent Platform\" to provide autonomous and robotic capabilities for commercial science research and manufacturing in low Earth orbit.\n    *   **Sierra Space** is focusing on developing a low Earth orbit ecosystem, including next-generation space transportation, in-space infrastructure, and expandable space facilities for human presence.\n*   **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** has established an Aerospace and Satellite Solutions group, targeting aerospace, satellite, and other space customers with its cloud computing infrastructure. AWS also offers \"Ground Station,\" which allows customers to control satellites and download data. Additionally, AWS holds a $10 billion contract with the National Security Agency for cloud computing services, including the transfer of intelligence data to the cloud.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   The **DOE**'s \"Genesis Mission\" with NVIDIA includes research in nuclear energy, covering both fission and fusion.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies & Prominent Investors/Industry Figures\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   Among the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla), **Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, and NVIDIA** are noted for having the most exposure to the AI investing theme. All Magnificent Seven companies have announced AI developments.\n*   **Apple** plans to invest over $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. This substantial investment includes expanding its AI infrastructure, building a new 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, to produce servers for \"Apple Intelligence\" (its personal intelligence system), and creating approximately 20,000 new research and development jobs focused on AI and machine learning.\n*   **Amazon** is investing over $100 billion into its cloud and AI infrastructure to address the demand for generative AI. Amazon also holds approximately 20% ownership in the AI company Anthropic, following an investment of over $8 billion.\n*   **Meta Platforms** is making significant investments in AI and related infrastructure. The company is reportedly pivoting its focus from the metaverse by planning deep cuts in its Reality Labs division to prioritize AI development. Meta has acquired the AI startup Limitless, known for its AI-powered pendant that records conversations, and has partnered with ElevenLabs for AI voice translation and conversion. Meta's Facebook AI Research (FAIR) actively collaborates with academic institutions, providing resources to foster AI research.\n*   **Microsoft** has introduced large language models and chatbots.\n*   **NVIDIA** is a frontrunner in AI chip development and has numerous partnerships to build advanced AI infrastructure.\n*   **Sam Altman**, CEO of OpenAI, has announced an impending agreement with the U.S. AI Safety Institute to provide early access to OpenAI's next major AI model for safety testing.
