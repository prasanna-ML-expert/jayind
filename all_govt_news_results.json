From quantum computing breakthroughs and AI acceleration strategies to drone development and space exploration initiatives, the focus remains on enhancing national security, economic competitiveness, and scientific discovery.\n\n### Government and Agency Announcements\n\n**Quantum Technology**\n*   ISARA Corporation and Carahsoft Technology Corp. announced a partnership on January 22, 2026, to accelerate quantum readiness for the U.S. government. Carahsoft will serve as ISARA's public sector distributor, providing quantum readiness solutions to federal agencies through various contracts, including NASA SEWP V. This initiative aims to implement autonomous cryptographic posture management with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to prepare for the post-quantum era, aligning with urgent national security priorities.\n*   D-Wave Quantum Inc. announced on January 27, 2026, that Florida Atlantic University (FAU) signed a $20 million agreement to purchase and install an Advantage2\u2122 annealing quantum computer. This aims to solidify Florida's position in quantum computing and advance education, research, and workforce development.\n*   D-Wave also collaborated with Davidson Technologies, Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. to develop quantum-classical hybrid applications for U.S. air and missile defense planning challenges, demonstrating an initial proof-of-concept.\n*   IonQ agreed to acquire semiconductor manufacturer SkyWater Technology for $1.8 billion on January 28, 2026, to accelerate the development and large-scale production of quantum computing systems for aerospace and defense customers. This move positions IonQ as a vertically integrated quantum computing company, strengthening its focus on federal contracts.\n*   Maryland Governor Wes Moore's proposed fiscal year 2027 budget includes a $74 million push for quantum investments, building on the \"Capital of Quantum\" initiative launched last January. This includes $20 million for a deep tech facility and $12 million to recruit faculty experts.\n\n**Drone Technology & Robotics**\n*   The Department of Transportation (DOT) reopened a request for information (RFI) on January 27, 2026, regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) handling of unmanned aircraft systems. The FAA is seeking insights on aircraft location-tracking devices, detection technologies, and safety standards to finalize drone-related rules.\n*   The Department of Defense (DoD) is heavily invested in drone technology, with the Army planning to manufacture 10,000 drones per month starting this year, and the Marine Corps aiming to procure 10,000 drones in 2026.\n*   The U.S. Air Force is advancing its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program in 2026, aiming to establish a fleet of \"loyal wingman\" drones to fly alongside crewed fighter jets by the end of the decade. A production decision is expected this year, potentially advancing prototypes from General Atomics and Anduril.\n*   The Pentagon's \"Blue UAS\" project, a list of approved drone providers for the U.S. government, has transitioned from the Defense Innovation Unit to the Defense Contract Management Agency, moving into a new phase of management as of January 26, 2026.\n*   NASA's Lunabotics Challenge invites university students to design and build prototype off-world construction robots to support future space exploration. The event dates are May 19-21, 2026, at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) opened a new funding round on January 14, 2026, for the University Reactor Sharing and Outreach Program. This initiative aims to strengthen nuclear science education, bolster workforce development, and broaden community engagement with nuclear technologies through grants totaling approximately $1 million, with individual awards up to $200,000.\n*   The Fiscal Year 2026 Consolidated Innovative Nuclear Research (CINR) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) was issued by the DOE Idaho Operations Office, with a pre-application deadline of January 28, 2026. This NOFO includes funding for U.S. university/college-led R&D projects and NSUF access.\n\n**AI and Innovative Technologies**\n*   The Department of War launched an Artificial Intelligence Acceleration Strategy on January 12, 2026, to establish the U.S. as the world's leading AI-enabled fighting force. This strategy, mandated by President Trump, focuses on experimentation, eliminating bureaucratic blockers, and integrating frontier AI capabilities across all mission areas.\n*   The U.S. government announced a new cross-government initiative called \"US Tech Force\" on January 8, 2026, to recruit around 1,000 technology specialists. These specialists will work on mission-critical projects across various departments, including AI implementation, application development, and data modernization.\n*   New AI supercomputer deployments are set to begin in early 2026, tackling complex scientific challenges, enabled by the Trump Administration's approach to computing partnerships and private investments.\n*   NASA is moving into a new phase of space exploration, with major progress across human spaceflight, science missions, and advanced technology, including plans for the Moon, Mars, and beyond, as of January 25, 2026.\n*   Oman officially joined NASA's Artemis Accords on January 26, 2026, becoming the 61st nation committed to principles guiding responsible exploration and utilization of outer space. The Artemis mission continues with scientific research and technological experiments in lunar orbit.\n\n### Investments by Prominent Companies and Industry Figures\n\n**AI and Quantum Technology**\n*   Alphabet (Google's parent company) is increasing its capital expenditures for 2026, with a focus on AI and quantum computing capabilities. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are seeing significant benefits from using AI to enhance their advertising businesses, with Meta planning aggressive spending on AI infrastructure.\n*   Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is actively seeking substantial funding from Middle East investors, reportedly aiming for at least $50 billion in a round that could value the AI company between $750 billion and $830 billion. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to go public towards the end of 2026 with a potential $1 trillion valuation. SoftBank Group is also looking to boost its stake in OpenAI with an additional investment of up to $30 billion. SoftBank liquidated its NVIDIA shares in October 2025 to shift its focus towards \"super-intelligence\" and vertically integrated AI systems through projects like \"Project Stargate.\"\n\n### Single-Stock 2x Leveraged ETFs\n\nBased on recent filings and launches, here is a table of single-stock 2x leveraged ETFs that have either launched in the last 30 days (since December 29, 2025) or are filed to launch in the next 3 weeks (until February 18, 2026), focusing on U.S. markets.\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----- | :-------------------- |\n| Applied Digital Corporation (APLD) | APLZ | -2x | Tradr ETFs | January 22, 2026 |\n| IREN Limited (IREN) | IREZ | -2x | Tradr ETFs | January 22, 2026 |\n| Lucid Group, Inc.
