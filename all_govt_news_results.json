    "news": "Here's a comprehensive overview of recent announcements, news, contracts, projects, and rumors in quantum tech, drone tech, robotics, space tech, satellite communication, nuclear energy, AI, and other innovative technologies, along with a list of recently launched or filed 2x leveraged single-stock ETFs.\n\n### Government and Defense Sector Developments\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is heavily investing in advancing nuclear power. In January 2026, the DOE announced a significant $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic uranium enrichment services over the next decade, supporting the expansion of U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and developing supply chains for high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU).\n\nIn December 2025, the DOE awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec to further the deployment of U.S. small modular reactors (SMRs). This was followed by a November 2025 announcement of the financial close of a $1 billion loan to Constellation for the Crane Clean Energy Center Restart nuclear power plant project in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe U.S. government established a strategic partnership with Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management in October 2025 to accelerate the development of Westinghouse's nuclear reactor technologies both domestically and internationally. Prior to this, in September 2025, the DOE selected four companies for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects aimed at strengthening domestic nuclear fuel supply chains. In August 2025, the DOE made conditional commitments to three U.S. companies to provide HALEU to meet near-term fuel needs and announced the initial selection of 11 projects for its Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program to move advanced nuclear technologies towards deployment, with a goal of achieving criticality for at least three reactors by mid-2026.\n\nCongress also passed the fiscal year 2026 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, earmarking $1.785 billion for the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy and reprogramming $3.1 billion for the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, supporting projects by companies like TerraPower and X-energy. An additional $150 million was provided to the Loan Programs Office for nuclear projects. Furthermore, the DOE and NASA have agreed to support research and development for a nuclear reactor on the Moon to enable future sustained lunar missions.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) unveiled a new AI strategy emphasizing rapid deployment and increased access to computational power, aiming to establish an \"AI-first warfighting force\" across all domains. This strategy, announced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a SpaceX facility, directs the DOD's Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO) to enable the deployment of the latest AI models from companies within 30 days of public release. The CDAO is also tasked with establishing benchmarks for \"model objectivity\" as a primary procurement criterion and executing \"Pace-Setting Projects,\" which include the controversial new GenAI.mil platform, speedy experimentation venues, new simulation capabilities, and a new network of AI agents. The DOD plans to leverage the American Science and Security Platform, developed as part of the DOE-led Genesis Mission, and invest significantly in computational resources, including data centers.\n\nThe DOE launched its \"Genesis Mission\" in November 2025, a coordinated national effort to build an integrated AI platform to utilize federal scientific datasets for training scientific foundation models and creating AI agents to accelerate scientific discovery. In January 2026, the DOE issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input on strategies to address the Genesis Mission's technical challenges and to develop a skilled American workforce in AI for science and engineering. In July 2025, the DOE also announced site selections for AI data center and energy infrastructure development on federal lands.\n\n**Quantum Technology**\nZenaTech, Inc. is advancing its proprietary quantum computing hardware platform, with a five-qubit quantum prototype expected to be operational later in 2026. This platform is designed for defense, homeland security, and government applications, capable of processing large, complex datasets from the company's ZenaDrone drones and drone swarms to provide real-time insights.\n\n**Drone Technology**\nAs mentioned above, ZenaTech's quantum computing platform will support its ZenaDrone drones and drone swarms for military and government applications, indicating ongoing development in the drone sector for defense purposes.\n\n**Robotics**\nL3Harris received an award for EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) disposal robots for the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\n**Space Technology**\nBeyond the nuclear reactor on the Moon initiative by DOE and NASA, the space sector saw significant investor interest following a report about a potential $1.5 trillion SpaceX IPO in 2026. Companies like Rocket Lab (RKLB) are seeing increased attention due to successful developments like their next-gen Neutron rocket and new funding. AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is actively building a global cellular broadband network in space for commercial and government use.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies and Prominent Investors\n\n**Magnificent 7 Companies (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla)**\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" continue to drive technological innovation, particularly in AI. Investors are actively buying into these stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOG) identified as recent favorites among AI investors. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management recently acquired shares in Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2026, betting on the continued AI boom.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Alphabet are recognized for their substantial AI investments. Meta Platforms (META) is notably leveraging AI to enhance user engagement and drive revenue, with its \"Advantage+\" ad tools generating an estimated $60 billion in annual recurring revenue. A JPMorgan survey in January 2026 indicated that 46% of respondents expect Amazon (AMZN) to be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock in 2026, with Meta being seen as a \"dark horse\" for a compelling catch-up trade. While these giants continue to perform, some analysts predict a broadening of the AI market, with mid-cap AI stocks potentially outperforming the Magnificent Seven in 2026.\n\n**Prominent Investors**\nWhile specific recent individual investments by Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, or Elon Musk into the listed companies were not detailed, Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, was mentioned in the context of the DOD's AI strategy announcement and a rumored IPO influencing the broader space sector.\n\n### ETF Analyst Report: Single-Stock 2x Leveraged ETFs\n\nHere is a table of 2x leveraged single-stock ETFs that have launched in the last 30 days (since December 23, 2025) or are filed to launch in the next 3 weeks (until February 12, 2026), focusing on U.S. markets.\n\n| Underlying Ticker | New ETF Ticker | Leverage Ratio | Issuer | Launch/Effective Date |\n| :---------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----- | :-------------------- |\n| APLD              | APLZ           | -2X            | Tradr  | 2026-01-21 |\n| IREN              | IREZ           | -2X            | Tradr  | 2026-01-21 |\n| LCID              | LCIZ           | -2X            | Tradr  | 2026-01-21 |\n| NBIS              | NBIZ           | -2X            | Tradr  | 2026-01-21 |\n| CRML              | CRMX           | 2X             | Tradr  | 2026-01-12 |\n| ONDS              | ONDU           | 2X             | Tradr  | 2026-01-12 |"
