These launches are scheduled between 2025 and 2026.\n*   **Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications (ESS):** In July 2025, SSC awarded a $2.8 billion contract to The Boeing Company to develop and deliver the first two satellites for the ESS program. This initiative aims to modernize nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) capabilities, replacing the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF) system.\n*   **Maneuverable GEO Satcom:** The U.S. Space Force's Commercial Satellite Communications Office (CSCO) is expected to award a contract for commercially derived maneuverable satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) in early 2026.\n*   **Missile Defense Satellite Constellation:** The Space Development Agency awarded approximately $2.5 billion in contracts to L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, and Sierra Space to construct 54 satellites for the Tranche 2 Tracking Layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), focusing on missile defense.\n*   **Protected Tactical Satellite Communications (PTS-G):** In July 2025, SSC awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and initial orders worth $37.5 million for the PTS-G program to Viasat, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Astranis Space Technologies Corp, Intelsat General Communications LLC, and The Boeing Company. The program aims to deliver resilient anti-jam SATCOM capabilities, with an award for production of PTS-G Space Vehicles planned for 2026.\n*   **Commercial SATCOM Transition:** The Space Force is gradually assuming responsibility for commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) bandwidth and services contracts from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), with a substantial $13 billion funding pool for low Earth orbit (LEO) internet services.\n*   **NASA Space Technology Partnerships:** NASA issued an Announcement of Collaboration Opportunity (ACO) in August 2025, open for five years, inviting industry partners to collaborate on advanced space technologies. This provides companies with access to NASA's expertise, facilities, software, and hardware, with the 2025 appendix proposals due in September 2025. Previous collaborations include Blue Origin for lunar landers and SpaceX for propellant transfer methods.\n*   **NASA Artemis Program:** SpaceX's Starship was selected by NASA in 2021 to serve as the human lander for the Artemis III and Artemis IV missions, with new Starship V3 architecture flight tests targeted for 2026.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   **Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program:** The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected 11 projects for a nuclear reactor pilot program in August and December 2025. The goal is to fast-track the development of advanced micro and small modular reactors, with hopes of fully developing three projects by July 2026 through expedited authorization and permitting.\n*   **Uranium Enrichment Investment:** In January 2026, the DOE announced a $2.7 billion investment to bolster domestic uranium enrichment capabilities.\n*   **Small Modular Reactor Funding:** The DOE awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec in December 2025 to advance the deployment of U.S. small modular reactors.\n*   **Westinghouse Partnership:** In October 2025, the U.S. Government formed a strategic partnership with Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management to accelerate the development of Westinghouse's nuclear reactor technologies.\n*   **Advanced Nuclear Fuel:** In September 2025, the DOE selected four companies for Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects to strengthen domestic nuclear fuel supply chains.\n*   **FY2026 Energy Funding:** In January 2026, the U.S. Senate passed an Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2026, allocating $1.785 billion to the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The bill also reprogrammed $3.1 billion from other DOE areas to the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, supporting projects by TerraPower and X-energy, and provided $150 million to the Loan Programs Office for nuclear project credit subsidies.\n\n**Robotics, AI & Latest Innovative Technologies**\n*   **National Robotics Strategy:** In December 2025, the Trump administration reportedly shifted its focus to robotics, with the Commerce Department considering a national executive order on robotics for 2026 to boost domestic advanced manufacturing. The Transportation Department is also developing a robotics working group. This initiative aims to blend AI and robotics for national competitiveness. In March 2025, The Association for Advancing Automation (A3) also released its vision for a U.S. National Robotics Strategy, advocating for a central government robotics office and a commission.\n*   **Defense Manufacturing Act:** The Future of Defense Manufacturing Act of 2025, introduced in July 2025, is a legislative effort to accelerate the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies, including additive manufacturing (3D printing), robotics, advanced materials, and digital engineering, across the Department of Defense.\n*   **NASA AI Initiatives:** In January 2026, NASA announced a cultural transformation to integrate AI for next-generation space missions. The agency is consolidating AI infrastructure across its centers and forging partnerships with industry and academia. An AI-enabled robot has been deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) for research, and AI is being used to design stronger spacecraft components and optimize mission schedules. NASA's AI strategy also includes projects in space exploration and mission support, as highlighted in July 2025.\n*   **Advanced Manufacturing Plan:** In October 2025, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a Request for Information (RFI) to update the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, focusing on federal programs and investments to enhance U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies, Prominent Investors & Industry Figures\n\n**SpaceX (Elon Musk)**\n*   Beyond government contracts mentioned above, SpaceX's Starlink generated the bulk of its income as of May 2025, supporting its Starshield military counterpart.
