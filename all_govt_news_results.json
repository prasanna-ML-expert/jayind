The White House's FY27 R&D objectives place AI and quantum science at the forefront of federal research. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has committed up to $50 billion to develop AI and supercomputing infrastructure specifically for U.S. government entities, adding approximately 1.3 gigawatts of compute capacity across various AWS government cloud regions. The Department of Energy (DOE) is set to allocate $400 million for quantum information science in fiscal year 2026, supporting national research centers, quantum networking, high-risk research, and workforce training. IonQ, a quantum computing company, announced its acquisition of SkyWater Technology for around $1.8 billion, a move aimed at accelerating its quantum computing roadmap and securing a domestic supply chain, positioning it as a key partner for the U.S. government.\n\n**Drone Technology**\nThe Pentagon has initiated its \"Drone Dominance Program,\" inviting 25 small technology and drone companies to compete in fielding thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones. Prototype orders totaling about $150 million are expected by early March 2026, with the program's overall cost estimated at $1.1 billion over four phases. Picogrid secured a $9.3 million Air Force contract for AI-powered software designed to integrate disparate counter-drone systems at Air Force bases. Ondas' American Robotics Optimus drone has received \"Blue List\" status from the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), facilitating its rapid federal procurement for defense and government missions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced new funding initiatives for counter-drone measures, including $250 million allocated by FEMA to 11 states to bolster counter-UAS and border security for events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Separately, the U.S. Air Force awarded Trust Automation a $490 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to develop and deploy counter-UAS capabilities through 2030.\n\n**Robotics**\nThe U.S. government is increasing its support for the robotics industry, with potential executive orders on the horizon. Robotics, particularly embodied AI, is seen as vital for national security, supply chain resilience, and economic competitiveness, forming a core part of the \"Genesis Mission\" to create a unified AI platform.\n\n**Space Technology & Satellite Communication**\nNASA launched its \"Space to Soil\" Challenge on January 30, 2026, inviting proposals for SmallSat missions that utilize adaptive sensing and onboard AI for Earth observation, focusing on real-time, in-orbit insight generation for terrestrial resources. CesiumAstro raised $470 million in Series C funding, including a $200 million financing package from the Export-Import Bank of the United States, to expand the manufacturing and deployment of space-based communication systems for government and commercial clients. Congress has introduced the Satellite and Telecommunications Streamlining Act to modernize the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) satellite licensing processes. SpaceX conducted its first national security mission of 2026, deploying U.S. spy satellites into orbit. NASA has several planned launches in mid-2026, including the SunRISE mission (six CubeSats for solar activity studies), the Aspera UV telescope, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope for cosmology and exoplanet research.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\nIn January 2026, the DOE awarded $2.7 billion to enhance domestic uranium enrichment, including $900 million contracts to three companies for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) services over a decade. An additional $28.5 million was allocated for advancing next-generation uranium enrichment technology, and $11 million for HALEU transportation packages. The Office of Nuclear Energy is slated to receive approximately $3.1 billion in reallocated funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support its Advanced Reactor Deployment Program. Oklo, a nuclear energy company, plans to utilize funding to develop its flagship facility and secure fuel supplies.\n\n**AI Workforce Initiatives**\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is launching Data Science Fellows and Project Management Fellows programs in Spring 2026. Each program aims to hire 250 fellows across government agencies to address critical skill gaps in AI and data science within the federal workforce.\n\n### Prominent Investor and Company Investments\n\n**Elon Musk (SpaceX, xAI)**\nElon Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI in a $1.25 trillion merger. This consolidation precedes SpaceX's anticipated IPO in June 2026, which aims to raise up to $50 billion. A primary driver for this merger is Musk's vision to establish orbital data centers for AI computing in space, with plans to deploy up to one million solar-powered satellites. SpaceX's Starlink service secured $733 million in Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program projects nationwide, including $109 million in Texas, though the company is seeking modifications to its contract terms.\n\n**Sam Altman (OpenAI)**\nOpenAI, recently valued at $500 billion, is reportedly in discussions to raise an additional $100 billion, potentially pushing its valuation to $750 billion or more. Sam Altman has announced plans for a staggering $1 trillion investment in data centers and has secured multi-billion-dollar agreements with chipmakers to bolster AI infrastructure. OpenAI is also reportedly considering an IPO by the end of 2026. The company is actively integrating its AI products into governmental, academic, and military sectors within the U.S..\n\n**Google**\nGoogle is intensifying its AI development efforts, which have contributed to a 13% increase in its emissions due to AI-enabled data centers. The company has made significant global investments in data center operations, including its largest investment to date in India ($15 billion for an AI data center) and new facilities in the Netherlands and Austria. Google's Gemini AI chatbot is rapidly advancing, intensifying competition in the AI landscape.\n\n**Magnificent 7 Companies (Other)**\nMeta and Amazon have made notable commitments in nuclear energy. Meta has a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Constellation for 1.1 gigawatts (GW), and Amazon has a 1.9 GW deal with Talen Energy for nuclear power.\n\n### ETF Analyst Report: Recent and Upcoming 2x Leveraged Single-Stock ETFs (U.S. Markets)\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently expressed concerns regarding the registration of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that seek to provide more than 200% (2x) leveraged exposure to underlying indices or securities. A letter sent by the SEC on December 2, 2025, to Direxion Shares ETF Trust indicated a pause in the substantive review of such filings until specific issues regarding risk measurement and compliance with Rule 18f-4 are addressed.\n\nDue to these regulatory concerns, specific launches of new 2x leveraged *single-stock* ETFs have been limited or delayed. While there are filings for leveraged products, obtaining precise launch dates for products filed to launch in the next three weeks, especially single-stock ones, is challenging due to the SEC's ongoing review process for highly leveraged products.\n\nBased on recent announcements and filings, here are relevant, though sometimes indirectly related, leveraged ETF activities:\n\n| Underlying Ticker (Expected) | New ETF Ticker (Expected) | Leverage Ratio | Issuer | Launch/Effective Date (Expected) | Notes |\n| :--------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------- | :----- | :------------------------------- | :---- |\n| Not specified (Cardano)      | Not specified (Cardano 2x) | 2x             | Volatility Shares | Filed to Launch (Date TBD)     | Volatility Shares has filed updates for a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF, among others, with NYSE Arca as the intended listing venue. This is a cryptocurrency, not a traditional single stock. |\n| Ondas Holdings (ONDS)        | Not specified             | 2x             | Tradr  | January 13, 2026                 | Tradr launched leveraged ETFs on Ondas Holdings, UiPath, and USA Rare Earth. While the specific ticker and \"2x\" for each is not explicitly linked, Tradr is known for leveraged products. |\n| UiPath (PATH)                | Not specified             | 2x             | Tradr  | January 13, 2026                 | Tradr launched leveraged ETFs on Ondas Holdings, UiPath, and USA Rare Earth. |\n| USA Rare Earth               | Not specified             | 2x             | Tradr  | January 13, 2026                 | Tradr launched leveraged ETFs on Ondas Holdings, UiPath, and USA Rare Earth. |\n\n**Note on Data Limitations:**\nDirect, real-time access to all SEC Form N-1A and 485BXT filings, specifically filtered for \"single-stock 2x leveraged ETFs\" with confirmed launch dates within the precise 30-day/3-week window, is not fully available through general search. The information above is derived from recent news that cites such filings and market activities. The SEC's intensified scrutiny on highly leveraged ETFs may mean that many such filings are pending effectiveness or require significant revisions before launch."
