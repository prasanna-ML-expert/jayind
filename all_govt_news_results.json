They are developing a Quantum Gravity Gradiometer Pathfinder (QGGPf) instrument, aiming for on-orbit testing by 2030 to measure Earth's gravitational field with unprecedented accuracy. This project involves collaborations with private companies such as AOSense, Infleqtion, and Vector Atomic.\n*   The Department of Energy (DOE) is integrating quantum computing into its efforts to build an integrated AI platform to accelerate scientific and national-security problem-solving.\n\n**Drone Technology**\n*   NASA is conducting ongoing research to integrate drones safely into low-altitude airspace through its Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM) project, which completed its final phase of flight tests in 2019.\n*   NASA has utilized Northrop Grumman-manufactured Global Hawk drones for climate research, studying atmospheric changes over the Pacific Ocean.\n*   NASA is also researching advanced air mobility (AAM), including electric air taxis and robot drones for various applications within and beyond Earth's atmosphere, and has conducted tests for drone safety over cities.\n*   Researchers at NASA's Langley Research Center recently flew multiple drones autonomously beyond line of sight for air taxi research.\n\n**Robotics**\n*   NASA has several active robotics projects, including the Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) project, which is developing a network of mobile robots for autonomous exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n*   NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has completed 51 autonomous flights on Mars.\n*   The Robonaut project has been conducting robotics research on the International Space Station (ISS) since 2012, with upgrades including climbing manipulators for Robonaut 2 (R2).\n\n**Space Technology & Satellite Communication**\n*   Elon Musk's SpaceX, which operates Starlink, received approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in December 2022 to launch up to 7,500 next-generation satellites for its internet network.\n*   SpaceX also plans to purchase the rights to use some of EchoStar's spectrum for $17 billion to support Starlink's direct-to-cell business.\n*   Peter Thiel's Founders Fund led a $20 million seed round investment in Impulse Space Propulsion, a company focused on in-orbit transfer services.\n\n**Nuclear Energy**\n*   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is involved in various nuclear energy initiatives.\n*   President Joe Biden updated rules on tax credit eligibility in January 2025, which has benefited nuclear power firms.\n*   Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced agreements related to nuclear power to support their data centers.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**\n*   The DOE has a long history of sponsoring basic research in AI and is building AI testbeds to provide secure ways for developers to test new AI tools, hardware, and algorithms.\n*   In December 2025, the DOE launched the \"Genesis Mission,\" a national effort to accelerate scientific discovery and improve national security using AI. This mission involves collaboration agreements with 24 major organizations, including Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Amazon Web Services, IBM, xAI, and Radical AI.\n*   The Department of Defense (DOD) has several leading AI initiatives, including Project Maven, Advana, Replicator, and Project Linchpin.\n*   In July 2025, the DOD's Chief Digital and AI Office awarded $200 million in contracts to xAI, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, signaling a shift towards agentic AI workflows for military, intelligence, and enterprise missions.\n*   The DOD adopted ethical principles for the use of AI in military operations in 2020 and has developed strategies to accelerate AI adoption.\n*   The fiscal year 2026 defense budget includes a request of approximately $13.4 billion for autonomy and autonomous systems, with $9.4 billion allocated for unmanned aerial vehicles and $210 million for autonomous ground vehicles.\n\n### Magnificent 7 Companies, Prominent Investors, and Industry Figures\n\n**Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO & Investor)**\n*   Sam Altman was a lead investor in Coco Robotics' $80 million Series B round in June 2025. This Santa Monica-based startup builds small delivery robots that use GPS, LiDAR cameras, and AI systems, partly powered by OpenAI models.\n*   Altman has been a prominent backer of Helion Energy (fusion power), making a $375 million investment in their $425 million Series F round in January 2025. He previously invested in Helion's Series E round in November 2021.\n*   He was also a lead seed investor in Oklo (fission power) in January 2015 and currently serves as the company's chairman. Oklo focuses on developing advanced nuclear fission power plants.\n*   Altman was a lead investor in Exowatt's seed round in April 2025, a startup developing modules to store energy as heat for AI data centers.\n*   OpenAI, led by Altman, led a Series A2 funding round for 1X (formerly Lahi Robotics), a startup manufacturing Androids for industrial tasks.\n*   OpenAI has partnered with Figure AI to develop AI models for humanoid robots.\n\n**Peter Thiel (Investor)**\n*   Peter Thiel, through Founders Fund, led a $20 million seed round for Impulse Space Propulsion in March 2022, a company founded by SpaceX co-founder Tom Mueller focused on in-orbit transfer services.\n*   Founders Fund also made a significant investment in Anduril, a defense hardware startup.\n*   Thiel holds shares in BlackSky, a space-based intelligence company, through Mithril.\n*   He also invests in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion company.\n\n**Elon Musk (CEO of SpaceX & Tesla)**\n*   Elon Musk has stated plans to invest between $30 billion and $40 billion in his Starlink satellite internet service. Starlink aims to provide global broadband internet with thousands of low-orbit satellites.\n*   SpaceX, founded by Musk, received $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity Investments in January 2015.\n\n**Magnificent 7 Companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla)**\n*   **AI**: Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia are identified as having the most exposure to the AI investing theme among the Magnificent Seven.
